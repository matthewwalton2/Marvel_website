The Thing has no apparent neck. He has only four fingers (including the thumb) on each hand and four toes on each foot. The increase in the volume of his fingers has not decreased his manual dexterity. His skin is apparently susceptible to "drying" or what in a normal human being would be called loss of skin oil, for his skin can be "chipped" under certain circumstances. The Thing has no outer ear structure.,	Origin,Human Mutate,Living Status,Alive,Reality,Earth-97161,	Identity,Public,Citizenship,American,Occupation,Adventurer,Base of Operations,Avengers Mansion, Manhattan, New York City, New York,	Creators,Chris Eliopoulos, Ig Guara,First,Avengers vs. Pet Avengers #2(November, 2010), It's Clobberin' Time! ,	Characters,New Avengers (Earth-97161)/Members,Male Characters,Mutates,Humans (Homo sapiens),Public Identity Characters,Chris Eliopoulos/Creator,Ig Guara/Creator,Single Characters,Blue Eyes,No Hair,Orange Skin,Rock Body,Living Characters,Earth-97161/Characters,Americans,Adventurers,2010 Character Debuts,Benjamin Grimm (Earth-97161)/Quotes,Cosmic Ray Exposure,Superhuman Strength,Grimm Family,
