Africian American Muslisms have not traditionally been terribly patriotic. Wh have, instead, more closely identified ourselves with the lost tribe of Shabazz--a misplaced people. Strangers in a strange land. In that view, I have offended some of our brethren with this flag. While, at the same time--I've inspired some people with it. Somewhere between those extremes, is where I belong. ,—Josiah X[src],	Characters,Name legally changed,Crew (Earth-616)/Members,Black Panther Party (Earth-616)/Members,United States Army (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Secret Identity Characters,Christopher Priest/Creator,Joe Bennett/Creator,Single Characters,Height 6 ft. 2 in.
