And when my duplicate offered to remake the world to make things better for her and her whole species, she turned her down. You know why? Because she believed in us. Because she believed in the idea that all of us--humans and squirrels-- are better together than apart. She knows our human failings better than anyone, and Tippy still thought we deserved a chance to fix things. She sacrificed herself for that idea. And we are gonna fix things. Right now. Starting with her. ,	Characters,Squirrel Scouts (Earth-616)/Members,U.S.Avengers (Earth-616)/Members,New Avengers (A.I.M.)
