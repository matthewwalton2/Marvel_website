Trying to reprogram all robotkind didn't work... but now I see it's because they're not the real problem. Machines make sense. It's humanity that's complicated... irrational... unruly. Once I've installed my new invention on the Stark Space Station, all that will change. Every man, woman and child will obey me... without question. This is my penultimate task. Once it is all completed, all that will remain... is the sole reason that I, Arno Stark, exist-- To save you all! ,	Characters,Stark Unlimited (Earth-616)/Members,Maria Stark Foundation (Earth-616)/Members,Baintronics Incorporated (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Mutates,Humans (Homo sapiens),Public Identity Characters,Kieron Gillen/Creator,Dale Eaglesham/Creator,Single Characters,Height 5 ft. 11 in.
