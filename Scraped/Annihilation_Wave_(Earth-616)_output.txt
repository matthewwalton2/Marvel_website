It was an incredibly powerful force, which has laid waste to galaxies, slaughtered numerous worlds, and has captured or killed cosmic beings.[2][3][4] It was both an armada with thousands of starships and an army with countless "bugs". Nearly a decade after the first Annihilation Wave, the latest Annihilation Wave had over 15,500 warships. It was an armada that consisted of 7,467 dreadnoughts, 4,678 destroyers, and 3,541 cruisers. Each of these warships carried a well-trained Annihilation Wave battalion.[5],	Organizations,Public Identity Organizations,Active Organizations,Keith Giffen/Creator,Scott Kolins/Creator,Earth-616/Organizations,2006 Organization Debuts,Cosmic Level Threats,Factions In The Game Of Worlds,High Level Threats,Negative Zoner,Interplanetary Organizations,Interdimensional Organizations,Alien Military Forces,Interstellar Fleets,
