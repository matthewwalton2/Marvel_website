A fabricated product of a life-creating system. Even better than the real thing. The last White Event changed Adam into something more--A Nightmask capable of navigating the dreamspace of human potential. But the cost of this power is temporal regression--A gradual return to his prefabricated, primordial state. This is believed to be a flaw--Some accidental glitch in one of the universal systems that made him what he is. But that's a simple, microscopic way of looking at a much broader dilemma. Don't you understand? Here at the end times, they're all broken systems. ,	Characters,Avengers (Earth-616)/Members,New Avengers (A.I.M.)
