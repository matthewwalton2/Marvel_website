They have walked among us for more than forty years, robbing us of independence and endangering our lives...and they call themselves superheroes! America is overrun with them, they have established footholds in Canada, Africa and the Middle East. Even Russia has not proven immune. Many of the creatures are individually as powerful as entire armies! And they number in hundreds...hundreds! We have encouraged them! Last month, President Ronald Reagan granted a full pardon to the mindless engine of destruction known as the Hulk. These monsters ignore our laws and threaten our freedom, yet we welcome them with open arms! They must be contained! But how? How do you contain a being that can uproot mountains or walk through walls? How do you reprimand creatures that are indestructible, that can bend the very lightning to their will? How do we suppress the supermen? But let them know this...Impregnable though they may be, humanity is aware of the menace they pose. We have closed our ranks against them and we stand determined...waiting to see who will make the next move! ,—Sir James Jaspers[src],	Characters,British Parliament (Earth-616)/Members,House of Commons (Earth-616)/Members,Conservative Party (UK) (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Mutants (Homo superior),No Dual Identity Characters,Alan Moore/Creator,Alan Davis/Creator,Single Characters,Height 6 ft. 0 in.
