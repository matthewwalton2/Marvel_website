"I speak without concern for the accusations / that I am too much or too little woman / that I am too Black or too white / or too much myself / and through my lips comes the voices / of the ghosts of our ancestors / living and moving among us." That poem was written by an African-American lesbian -- but, in my opinion, the sentiment speaks to every American -- no one should have to be ashamed of their culture, or who they in large part are. ,—Captain Marvel[src],After being bombarded with extra-dimensional energy emmited by a stolen device, harbor patrol officer Monica Rambeau acquired the ability to convert her body mass into any form of energy of the electromagnetic spectrum, granting her the alias of Captain Marvel.[2] Unable to achieve success in the navy as she faced adversities as a black woman, Rambeau met recognition with the Avengers.[10] Her competence led her to become one of the most trustworthy members of the group and, in due course, their chairwoman.[11],However, Rambeau succumbed to a tragic fate when the Avengers were betrayed by Doctor Druid. As a consequence, she was gravely wounded in combat and lost her powers.[12] After a slow recovery,[13] she was welcomed back to the Avengers, sporadically assisting the team in times of need.[14] In another dramatic turn of events, Rambeau was manipulated by the Beyond Corporation into commanding their super-hero team, Nextwave. Upon learning their vile intentions, Rambeau and her team went rogue and dismantled Beyond. However, she was forever scarred by such an experience, having her personality drastically changed by it.[15],	Characters,Strikeforce (Earth-616)/Members,Ultimates (Earth-616)/Members,Mighty Avengers (Cage) (Earth-616)/Members,Secret Avengers (Civil War) (Earth-616)/Members,Nextwave (Earth-63163)/Members,Queen's Vengeance (Earth-398)/Members,Avengers (Earth-616)/Members,New Orleans Harbor Patrol (Earth-616)/Members,Female Characters,Mutates,Humans (Homo sapiens),Public Identity Characters,Roger Stern/Creator,John Romita Jr./Creator,Single Characters,Height 5 ft. 10 in.
