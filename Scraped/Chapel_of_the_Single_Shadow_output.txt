	Creators,Warren Ellis, Roland Boschi,First,Karnak #3(April, 2016), You recall my lesson on the three worlds? This is no world. This is a universe before life.

The savior of the universe would therefore come to uncreate it. Reduce it to a single shadow. ,	Locations,Earth-616/Locations,Warren Ellis/Creator,Roland Boschi/Creator,Milky Way,Sol,Earth,Europe,Transia,Balkans,2016 Location Debuts,Karnak Mander-Azur (Earth-616)/Quotes,Locales,
