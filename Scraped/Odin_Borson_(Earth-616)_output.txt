I am an old man--foolish and fond, and quick with my temper. There are times I show little wisdom. And yet...here is wisdom. The strange wisdom of the world-tree I gave this eye to. The tree that is everything. That has its roots and branches in all that is. There are ten realms in this reality--ten spheres, ten universes, and the tree winds through them all. Through every star and planet. Every hero and villain. Every life. Every story. I am Odin Borson, who build the world from corpse-meat. I am Odin One-Eye, and sometimes my one eye is open. But above all, I am Odin All-Father. I am the one who speaks for the tree. I am the king of all stories...and you are my child. ,—Odin[src],	Characters,Council of Godheads (Earth-616)/Members,Avengers (1,000,000 BC) (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Hybrids,Frost Giants,Aesir,Deities,Virtual Immortals,No Dual Identity Characters,Stan Lee/Creator,Larry Lieber/Creator,Jack Kirby/Creator,Separated Characters,Height 6 ft. 9 in.
