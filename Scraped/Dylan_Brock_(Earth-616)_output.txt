I will be at your side at what is to come. I will protect you to the best of my ability. And I will never betray you... but I must ask one thing... when are you going to tell Eddie what you really are? ,—Sleeper[src],Dylan Brock is the son of Eddie Brock and Anne Weying. When Anne bonded to the Venom symbiote, she somehow became pregnant with Dylan. He was created by the symbiotes in order to destroy their god Knull and sever him from the hive-mind. Leaving him as an infant with his paternal grandfather, Carl Brock, she would eventually commit suicide as she was traumatized by what she had done as She-Venom.[2][3][4],Growing up, Dylan believed Carl to be his father, and was shocked to learn he had an "elder brother" named Eddie. When Eddie came to their house to reconcile with his father, he was surprised to find out about Dylan's existence. Dylan came to him so they could kill Carl, though later admitting he only wanted his "father" to stop physically hurting him. He decided to stay with Eddie until he had a hallucination of Knull and entered in a coma. Haunted by his nightmares, Eddie discovered that Dylan was his son, so he decided to take Dylan with him, keeping this revelation a secret.[5],However, when Carnage was collecting trace remnants of symbiotes from the previous hosts' spines and was about to do the same with Dylan since he is Anne's codex incarnated in human form, Eddie killed him, accidentally freeing Knull from his Klyntar and letting slip he's Dylan's father.[6],	Characters,Male Characters,Hybrids,Humans (Homo sapiens),No Dual Identity Characters,Donny Cates/Creator,Iban Coello/Creator,Single Characters,Height 4-5 ft.
