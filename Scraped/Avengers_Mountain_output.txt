	Creators,Jason Aaron, David Marquez,First,Avengers (Vol. 8) #8(September, 2018), They want to give us a gift. The Progenitor. The first Celestial to ever visit the Earth. The one whose death gave birth to us all. They can't bring it back to life after so long, but... they don't want it to be buried anymore. It belongs in the sun. Shining like a beacon at the top of the world it helped forge. A beacon of hope. And of the wonders of life. And a warning about what'll happen... if anyone ever tries to stomp those out. ,	Locations,Earth-616/Locations,Jason Aaron/Creator,David Marquez/Creator,Milky Way,Sol,Earth,North America,Arctic Circle,North Pole,2018 Location Debuts,Roberto Reyes (Earth-616)/Quotes,Arctic Ocean,Avengers Bases,
