Parker)Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse(December 12, 2018)(As Spider-Man), My name is Peter B. Parker. I was bitten by a radioactive spider. And for the last twenty-two years, I thought I was the one and only Spider-Man. I’m pretty sure you know the rest. Y'see, I saved the city, fell in love, I got married, saved the city some more, maybe too much, my marriage got testy, made some dicey money choices (don’t invest in a Spider-themed restaurant). Then, like, fifteen years passed, blah, blah, blah, super boring, I broke my back, a drone flew into my face, I buried Aunt May, my wife and I... split up. But I handled it like a champion. 'Cause, you know what, no matter how many times I get hit, I always get back up. ,	Characters,Spider-Gang (Earth-TRN700)/Members,Male Characters,Mutates,Humans (Homo sapiens),Secret Identity Characters,Jeff Pinkner/Creator,Scott Rosenberg/Creator,Kelly Marcel/Creator,Divorced Characters,Hazel Eyes,Brown Hair,Living Characters,Earth-TRN701/Characters,Americans,Adventurers,Vigilantes,2018 Character Debuts,Peter Parker (Earth-TRN701)/Quotes,Human/Spider Hybrids,Interdimensional Travelers,Leaders,Radioactive Spider-Powered,Precogs,Superhuman Agility,Superhuman Durability,Superhuman Speed,Superhuman Stamina,Superhuman Strength,Wallcrawling,Web-Slinging,Reilly Family,Parker Family,Watson Family,Jewish Characters,Depression,
