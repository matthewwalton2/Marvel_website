	Creators,Jonathan Hickman, Rags Morales,First,New Avengers (Vol. 3) #16.NOW(March, 2014), The Great Society was formed four years ago after Archetypes of J.U.S.T.I.C.E. fell during The Invasion. Six heroes of the Anti-Heroic Age, the Society-- Outcasts all--Banded together to repel the mad science of the Xeno-Geneticists. Men were not meant to be remade by alien Gods, and when those Gods were cast out, the Age of J.U.S.T.I.C.E. had ended and the Great Society had begun. They saved the world and were lifted up as saviors. Their home was a temple-- a monument erected for The Science Games. A tower pointing towards the stars, and possibly something beyond even that. They were the greatest heroes their world had ever seen. They should have been enough. ,	Realities,Existing Realities,Jonathan Hickman/Creator,Rags Morales/Creator,2014 Reality Debuts,Earth-4290001,T'Challa (Earth-616)/Quotes,Realities with Destroyed Earths,Earths Destroyed by the Illuminati,
