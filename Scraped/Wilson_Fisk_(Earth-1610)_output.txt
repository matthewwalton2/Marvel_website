I do think that. It is my philosophy. They- people want to be told what to do and how to live and they want men like me to tell them. They want to go to work and do as little as they can possibly get away with, and they want a big cookie at the end of the day for doing it. And they want men like me to give it to them. And if it wasn't me it would be someone else. ,	Characters,Male Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),Known to Authorities Identity Characters,Brian Michael Bendis/Creator,Mark Bagley/Creator,Married Characters,Height 6 ft. 7 in.
