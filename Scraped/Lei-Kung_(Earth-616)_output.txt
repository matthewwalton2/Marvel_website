Do you know the secret of forever? I want to tell you something my father once told me. Decapitation, asphyxiation, blunt trauma, strangulation... Any number of paths to a single result. Your heart stops beating. Don't you see? All death comes from the heart. Armor yourself... Make your body hard and keep your heart soft. If you can protect your heart, you will never die. This is the secret of forever. You may feel like an outsider now... But one day, if you earn it, you will be invited to eat the fruit of immortality. And then you will truly be among us. ,	Characters,Male Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),Secret Identity Characters,Len Wein/Creator,Roy Thomas/Creator,Larry Hama/Creator,Single Characters,Black Eyes,Bald,Deceased Characters,Earth-616/Characters,K'un-Lunans,Teachers,Leaders,1974 Character Debuts,Lei-Kung (Earth-616)/Quotes,True Immortals,Chi Manipulation,Martial Arts,Thrown Weapons,Fencing,Lei-Kung Family,
