I was bitten by a radioactive spider, and for ten years, I've been the one and only Spider-Man. I’m pretty sure you know the rest. I saved a bunch of people, fell in love, saved the city, and then I saved the city again, and again and again, and again. Look, I'm a comic book, I'm a cereal, did a Christmas album. I have an excellent theme song. But after everything, I still love being Spider-Man. I mean, who wouldn't? So no matter how many hits I take, I always find a way to come back. Because the only thing standing between this city and oblivion is me. There's only one Spider-Man. And you're looking at him. ,	Characters,Male Characters,Mutates,Humans (Homo sapiens),Public Identity Characters,Phil Lord/Creator,Christopher Miller/Creator,Married Characters,Blue Eyes,Blond Hair,Deceased Characters,Earth-TRN700/Characters,Killed by Wilson Fisk (Earth-TRN700),Americans,Musicians,Adventurers,Vigilantes,Students,Engineers,2018 Character Debuts,Peter Parker (Earth-TRN700)/Quotes,Modern-Age Characters,Armor Users,Human/Spider Hybrids,Radioactive Spider-Powered,Leaping,Precogs,Superhuman Agility,Superhuman Durability,Superhuman Reflexes,Superhuman Speed,Superhuman Stamina,Superhuman Strength,Wallcrawling,Web-Slinging,Parker Family,Watson Family,Chemists,			Languages			 ,Русский,
