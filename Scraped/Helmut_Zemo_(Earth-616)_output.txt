Morality, shifting concept, bending to the will of the conqueror. It is the perspective of the victor that forms history, and defines the future. So long as you win, you claim the moral high ground--No matter the means you used to claim it. The Christians knew this when they launched their crusades. Napoleon and Alexander dreamed of a world united and understood the bloodshed it demanded. And the Americans knew this when they dropped their a-bombs. You and your progeny will know only opulence, wealth, and comfort, Lucas. You will not only save the world--You will be its king. The brave young man who brought an end to our crusade--And a beginning to the Age of Hydra! ,—Baron Helmut Zemo[src],	Characters,Thunderbolts (Earth-616)/Members,Hydra (Earth-616)/Members,Masters of Evil (Earth-616)/Members,High Council of Hydra (Earth-616)/Members,Army of Evil (Earth-616)/Members,Secret Empire (Earth-616)/Members,V-Battalion (Earth-616)/Members,Redeemers (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),No Dual Identity Characters,Roy Thomas/Creator,Tony Isabella/Creator,Sal Buscema/Creator,Widowed Characters,Height 5 ft. 10 in.
