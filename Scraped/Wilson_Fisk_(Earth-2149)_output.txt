My people found our friend, Dr. Strange, here, buried under a heap of cars and somewhat the worse for wear. He can cast only two spells now... one causes manna to fall from the heavens. Quite inedible to our kind, I'm afraid. But the other casts windows to interdimensional crossroads with our world. And that is how we found your reality. Learned of your A.R.M.O.R., your Nexus of All Realities, same as ours. And your wonderful Avengers Initiative. All those super-people. So regimented. So organized. The Gospel loves to spread to superhumans, you see. Most efficient. And we only exist to spread the Hunger Gospel. We sent our counterpart to one of your A.R.M.O.R. people first. He was able to penetrate The Hollow and replace his double before anyone noticed there were two of them. Then we sent a provocateur, which would cause your authorities to panic - allow our man to propose a vaccine. Your world has a ridiculous number of superhumans, you see. We could not be sure the Gospel could spread beyond the point of no return before it was stopped. So now we have some insurance. Your super people will be forced to be 'inoculated'... with the Gospel. As soon as your robot friend with the last component Morbius needs to convincingly fake his 'vaccine', the mass infection of the initiative shall begin... and your world will fall. ,	Characters,Zombies (Earth-2149)/Members,Male Characters,Zombies,Undead,Humans (Homo sapiens),Public Identity Characters,John Layman/Creator,Fabiano Neves/Creator,Widowed Characters,White Eyes,Bald,Living Characters,Earth-2149/Characters,Americans,Criminals,2006 Character Debuts,Wilson Fisk (Earth-2149)/Quotes,Fisk Family,Crimelords,Cannibals,
