I don't think anything can really beat the pure fun and pleasure of holding a magazine in your hand, reading the story on paper, being able to roll it up and put it in your pocket, reread again later, show it to a friend, carry it with you, toss it on a shelf, collect them, have a lot of magazines lined up and read them again as a series. I think young people have always loved that. I think they always will. ,--Stan Lee (Brandweek, May 2000),   Lou Ferrigno & Stan Lee  ,Stanley Martin Lieber (he would later change his name to Stan Lee) was born on December 28, 1922, to Celia and Jack Lieber. His ancestry is Ashkenazi Jewish. The first issue that Stan Lee ever wrote was Captain America Comics #3.,He wanted to leave around the time he wrote the Fantastic Four.
