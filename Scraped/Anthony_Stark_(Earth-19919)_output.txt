I can feel what's left of my mind going. That's why it has to be me. Pretty soon I'll be like Osborn.  I'd rather go out like this. As myself. I spent so much of my life building weapons. Weapons that killed and maimed soldiers like you. While I caroused on private jets with Dom Pérignon and supermodels. I always thought nothing I did as Iron Man could ever really make up for that. But I hope... maybe this does. ,	Characters,Resistance (Earth-19919)/Members,Brain Trust (Earth-19919)/Members,Avengers (Earth-19919)/Members,Male Characters,Mutates,Goblin Formula,Humans (Homo sapiens),Americans,Christos N.
