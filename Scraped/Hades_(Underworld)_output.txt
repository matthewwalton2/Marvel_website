Hades is actually a pocket dimension accessible both from Earth and from Olympus, as well as one of the Splinter Realms[1] (also known as the "Archipelago of Anguish and Redemption").[2],Hades has typically been ruled by Pluto (although others have ruled the domain from time to time).[3] They then pass the guardian Cerberus, who can take the form of a gigantic humanoid warrior or of a savage three-headed dog. The arriving spirits pass through the dismal Asphodel Fields to a section called Erebus where the palace of Pluto and Persephone stands.[3],	Locations,Archipelago of Anguish and Redemption,Dimensions,Don Rico/Creator,Pete Tumlinson/Creator,Many Hands/Creator,Chu Hing/Creator,Pierce Rice/Creator,1949 Location Debuts,Greece,Olympus,Realm of Death,Odyssey,
