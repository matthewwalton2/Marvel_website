DeMatteis, Mark Bagley,First,Spider-Man and Batman #1(September, 1995), But isn't that what you want to hear, doctor? That I was a poor, abused child? That my mother beat me? My father molested me? That I was tortured and hung by ankles over a pit of broken glass? Well, maybe that's all true. Or, maybe... I'm just the inevitable aberration. The soul that's born so black, so twisted, so filled with unreasoning hatred... that there's no explanation. You can't make me sane, doctor. You can't hope to redeem me. All you can do is kill me. Because, if you don't-- I'll break out of here. You have my word on that. And the blood-- the glorious blood-- will flow like wine! ,	Characters,Male Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),Public Identity Characters,J.M.
