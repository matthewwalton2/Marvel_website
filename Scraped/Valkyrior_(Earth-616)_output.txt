	Creators,Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, Joe Sinnott,First,Journey into Mystery #91(February, 1963),The Valkyries were female demigodesses who conducted the souls of Asgardian warriors slain in battle to Valhalla, an area of the Asgardian dimension. They consisted of nine warriors who rode winged horses, and were led by Brunnhilde. In ancient times, the Valkyries used to take the mortally wounded human heroes from German and Scandinavian battlegrounds as well. The Valkyries were no longer able to perform this task when Odin, ruler of Asgard, vowed to the Celestials a millennium ago that he would severely restrict Asgardian contact with Earth.[citation needed],Preface,It should be noted that the concept of warrior-women riding flying horses and conveying the souls of the worthy fallen warriors to the afterlife is frequent in mythology:,Circa 500,000 BC, Father Gorm's War Maids rode, bearing the spirits of fallen warriors to him.[4],Until circa 10,000 BC, during the Hyborian Age of Conan, Bori's Choosers of the Slain performed the same deed.[1][5],	Teams,Secret Identity Teams,Stan Lee/Creator,Larry Lieber/Creator,Joe Sinnott/Creator,Active Teams,Earth-616/Teams,1963 Team Debuts,Valkyries,
