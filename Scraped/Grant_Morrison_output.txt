Morrison's stint on X-Men is considered one of their more controversial runs, as they radically altered many aspects of the book. They introduced many new concepts including the Weapon Plus program, Fantomex, secondary mutations, the drug Kick, and portrayed Magneto as a senile genocidal madman. Morrison ended many long established X-Men tropes, including disposing with their superhero costumes, ending the marriage of Scott Summers and Jean Grey by involving Cyclops in a psychic affair with The White Queen, and once again killing Jean Grey, this time by giving her a massive, catastrophic stroke. Despite all the changes, the series was still well received.,Work History,185 subject(s) created by "Grant Morrison" ,1 work(s) that "Grant Morrison" edited,69 work(s) that "Grant Morrison" wrote,See Also,Links and References,https://www.grantmorrison.com/,Footnotes,↑ From the "Invisible Ink" column featured in DC's Invisibles #1,↑ Grant Morrison Surveys the Situation In “The Age of Horus”.
