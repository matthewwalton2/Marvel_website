	Creators,Al Ewing, Greg Land,First,Last,Mighty Avengers (Vol. 2) #1(September, 2013),Captain America and the Mighty Avengers #9(June, 2015), There's a word we use. Everyone who's ever served as an Avenger, we've spoken that word. Hell, it's a competition to say it. To shout it. Because it is that sacred to what we are and what we do. And that word is assemble. When we come together, we're stronger than when we stand apart. That's what it's always been about. We come together to fight what can't be fought alone. To defeat those things in the world that would drag us down. That would make us lesser. Those things no single hero can withstand. And by we? I mean all of us. When we make the effort to help those who need us-- to help each other, to be there for each other -- we are all Avengers. You are Avengers. ,	Teams,Public Identity Teams,Al Ewing/Creator,Greg Land/Creator,Defunct Teams,Earth-616/Teams,2013 Team Debuts,Luke Cage (Earth-616)/Quotes,Detective Agencies,
