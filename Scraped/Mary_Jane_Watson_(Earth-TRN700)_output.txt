He always said it could've been anyone behind the mask. He was just the kid who happened to get bit. He didn't ask for his powers, but he chose to be Spider-Man. My favorite thing about Peter is that he made us each feel powerful. We all have powers of one kind or another. But in our own way, we are all Spider-Man. And we’re all counting on you. ,	Characters,Female Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),No Dual Identity Characters,Phil Lord/Creator,Christopher Miller/Creator,Widowed Characters,Blue Eyes,Red Hair,Living Characters,Earth-TRN700/Characters,Americans,2018 Character Debuts,Mary Jane Watson (Earth-TRN700)/Quotes,Parker Family,Watson Family,
