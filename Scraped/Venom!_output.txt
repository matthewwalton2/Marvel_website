Initially the high school tormentor of Peter Parker,[15] whose secret alter-ego of the super hero Spider-Man also happened to be Flash's biggest idol,[16] Thompson grew out of his abusive behavior and befriended Peter in college.[17] Flash joined the Army and was stationed in Southeast Asia,[18] but had trouble finding a place to fit when he returned to the States.[19] Flash spiralled into depression and combated alcoholism,[20] an addiction that was exploited by the villainous Norman Osborn to involve him in a car crash.[21] This left Flash in a near-vegetative state after waking up from a coma.[22] Flash eventually regained his full faculties, and became a gym teacher at his old school.[23],	Characters,Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)/Members,Agents of the Cosmos (Earth-616)/Members,Avengers (Earth-616)/Members,Thunderbolts (Red Hulk) (Earth-616)/Members,Oscorp (Earth-616)/Members,Secret Avengers (Black Ops Unit) (Earth-616)/Members,Project Rebirth (Earth-616)/Members,Sym-Soldier Program (Earth-616)/Members,United States Army (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),Cyborgs,Known to Authorities Identity Characters,Stan Lee/Creator,Steve Ditko/Creator,Single Characters,Height 4-5 ft.
