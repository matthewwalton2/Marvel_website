The honest guy who got banged up for a crime he never committed. The guy who became a cop just to make sure nobody else ever had to face what I did. I'm the guy who made it my life's purpose to clean up the law, so no one walking the streets has anything to fear from it. Unless they break it, of course. I'm the most honest, the most trusted police commissioner to have ever held the rank. Anyone'll tell you that. ,	Characters,Name legally changed,Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (Earth-TRN852)/Members,Male Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),No Dual Identity Characters,Jason Aaron/Creator,R.M.
