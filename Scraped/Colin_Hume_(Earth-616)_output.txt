I tried to get out of it. I did. But I still wanted to... leave something behind. Thought I'd make art. Touch people with beauty. But there was something about my time as Wind-Shear. The look on the faces of people when I arrived. The feeling of being... bigger. I did... questionable things while I worked for Roxxon. But that didn't matter when I put on the mask. That "silly costume" makes me a symbol, not a man. Those "bright colors" can't be stained by past mistakes and regret. Those colors are a symbol, X-23, for the most uncomplicated, most untainted elements of what truly lies in our souls. In an age of mistrust and divisiveness, we need a few things that are just bloody simple and pure. ,	Characters,Alpha Flight (Earth-616)/Members,Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)/Members,Canadian Armed Forces (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Mutants (Homo superior),Secret Identity Characters,Fabian Nicieza/Creator,Michael Bair/Creator,Single Characters,Height 6 ft. 0 in.
