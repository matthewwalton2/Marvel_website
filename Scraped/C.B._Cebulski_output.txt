In 2011, he became the Vice President of International Brand Management. On November 17, 2017, it was announced that C.B. Cebulski succeeded Axel Alonso as Marvel Comics' Editor-in-Chief.[1],Work History,147 subject(s) created by "C.B. Cebulski" ,4215 work(s) that were produced while "C.B. Cebulski" was Editor-in-Chief,390 work(s) that "C.B. Cebulski" edited,62 work(s) that "C.B. Cebulski" wrote,40 subject(s) created by "Akira Yoshida" ,41 work(s) that "Akira Yoshida" wrote,Notes,From 2004 to 2005, Cebulski worked for Marvel under the pseudonym of Akira Yoshida. Apparently, Cebulski was planning to leave Marvel, but set up a writing career first as Yoshida, a persona created to get his first writing gig on Darkstalkers for Dreamwave and then Conan and the Demons of Khitai for Dark Horse. From that gig, his fictional pseudonym was approached by another Marvel editor, quite unaware that Cebulski was Akira, and Cebulski found himself hired by his own company. Cebulski kept the lie going, and even created a fake backstory for interviews, since at the time a policy in Marvel prohibited staffers from writing or drawing comic books. Barely a year afterwards, Cebulski confessed to Marvel executives what he had done, and the persona of Akira Yoshida faded away. Looking back on this, Cebulski recalled, "I stopped writing under the pseudonym Akira Yoshida after about a year. It wasn't transparent, but it taught me a lot about writing, communication and pressure. I was young and naïve and had a lot to learn back then."[2][3],See Also,Links and References,Footnotes,↑ Gustines, George Gene (17 November 2017). Marvel Entertainment Names New Editor in Chief.
