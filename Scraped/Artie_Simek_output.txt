He was the father of Jean Simek Izzo ("second generation letterer"). Artie Simek passed away on February 20th, 1975. He was publicly mourned that month in Marvel's Bullpen Bulletins. As per the Grand Comics Database, Simek's final work was lettering pages 2â€“8 and 10 of the 32-page superhero story "Eelar Moves in Mysterious Ways" in Giant-Size Defenders #5 (July 1975), which an editorial note on the letters page describes as the last Simek completed before his death while working on the issue.,Professional History,Artie Simek was one of Marvel's two primary comics letterers during the Silver Age, the other being Sam Rosen. He designed the logos for Fantastic Four and other titles.,Work History,381 work(s) where "Artie Simek" created a cover,1 work(s) that "Artie Simek" edited,1 work(s) that "Artie Simek" inked,2 work(s) that "Artie Simek" colored,1323 work(s) that "Artie Simek" lettered,Images Drawn by Artie Simek,122 covers drawn by "Artie Simek" ,30 images colored by "Artie Simek" ,1263 images lettered by "Artie Simek" ,Notes,The letters page of Fantastic Four #281 credits Art Simek as providing the inks for Fantastic Four #1.  Jack Kirby also said that Artie Simek had inked that issue. Though Simek lettered this ground-breaking issue, there is no clear evidence that he ever did any inking in the comics field. Several comic historians doubt the plausibility of this attribution, as Kirby had a notoriously bad memory. The current consensus is that George Klein was the inker, perhaps assisted by Christopher Rule (according to the Grand Comics Database, agreed upon by the first volume of Fantastic Four, from the Marvel Masterworks series).,Sometimes mistakenly credited as "Arty" Simek.,In the Bullpen Bulletins page of several comics, including Marvel Premiere #24, there was an announcement about Artie's death.,Trivia,Artie Simek would get the lousiest credits in each issue. For example in Journey Into Mystery #121 the credits read: "Another towering triumph for Stan Lee, Writer [...] Another day, another dollar, for Artie Simek, letterer." In Tales of Suspense #58, the credits read "Lettering of Breath-taking Adequacy by: Art Simek." Another time, his name was largest in the credits, with the explanation that "this was cheaper than giving him a raise." Though this might seem unfair to current comic book readers, letterers seldom (if ever) received credit for their work before Stan Lee instituted this as a policy at Marvel in late 1962.,He played the spoons.,See Also,Links and References,http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Artie_Simek,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artie_Simek,Footnotes,Like this?
