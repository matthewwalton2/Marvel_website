Point One #1(October, 2012), My name is Darla Deering, and I got my first recording contract when I was fourteen. By the time I was eighteen I had seven number-one hits, two golds, and one platinum record. I won a Grammy at nineteen, and ever since I could drive, I took home every Video Music Award that MTV ever nominated me for. I have twenty-nine million Yamblr followers. 67 million likes on Facespace. More people watched me on NewToob last year than go to the movies. And Bentley-23 is my friend. ,	Characters,Ant-Man Security Solutions (Earth-616)/Members,Fantastic Four (Earth-616)/Members,Future Foundation (Earth-616)/Members,Female Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),Public Identity Characters,Matt Fraction/Creator,Michael D.
