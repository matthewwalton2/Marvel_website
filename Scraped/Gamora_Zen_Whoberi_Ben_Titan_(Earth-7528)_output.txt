She is the sole survivor of the Zen-Whoberis, who were exterminated by the Universal Church of Truth, worshippers of the Magus. Taken by Thanos to the past, she was forged from victim into the killer of the Magus.[13] Under Thanos' care, Gamora was trained as an elite assassin and had her body mechanically improved.[14] Gamora's mission eventually led her to meet Adam Warlock, the Magus' younger self.[15] As a temporal anomaly, Gamora's help was crucial for Warlock and Thanos to defeat the Magus.[16] With the Magus defeated, events in the future changed so that her people were slaughtered by the Badoon instead, and Gamora's memories events have been affected by these timeline changes.[12],Gamora questioned her father's macabre obsession with death and ultimately betrayed him, joining Warlock.[17] Alongside Warlock, she became a regular player in major cosmic adventures, becoming a member of his Infinity Watch and being a protector of the Time Stone.[18] During the Annihilation Wave invasion, Gamora got close with other cosmic protectors, such as Nova, whom she got romantically involved with.[19] After Hala was conquered by the Phalanx and Ultron, Gamora was invited by Peter Quill to be part of a team of protectors to act in a preventive manner against galactic threats, the Guardians of the Galaxy.[5],	Characters,Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)/Members,West Spiral Arm Guardians (Earth-616)/Members,Nova Corps (Earth-616)/Members,Red Team (Earth-15513)/Members,Infinity Watch (Earth-616)/Members,Graces (Earth-616)/Members,United Front (Earth-616)/Members,Selects (Earth-616)/Members,Female Characters,Zen-Whoberis,No Dual Identity Characters,Jim Starlin/Creator,Single Characters,Height 6 ft. 0 in.
