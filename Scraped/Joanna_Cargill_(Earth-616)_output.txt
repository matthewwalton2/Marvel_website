When you're a soldier, the red rage carries you. Sees you safely through. Like a lucky rabbit's foot. Like armor that you wear on the inside. But even before that -- before Fortress X -- it was always there. The blood tide. The hot wire, in my brain, glowing like the filament in a light bulb. Bright, bright red. Even when I love someone, it feels like that. Like I'm halfway fighting them. Tearing some trophy of joy or lust out of their lips. Their flesh. Feeding that red screaming thing at the core of me. And I'm sort of thinking I should have asked this sooner. Who am I? Who's the me that's here, now, staring in this mirror? Thinking these thoughts? Joanna Cargill? Sometimes. Not too often. Frenzy. To name it is to own it. ,	Characters,X-Men (Earth-616)/Members,Royal Inhuman Diplomatic Mission (Earth-616)/Members,Acolytes (Earth-616)/Members,Alliance of Evil (Earth-616)/Members,Femizons (Earth-616)/Members,Genoshan Cabinet (Earth-616)/Members,Genoshan Unified Military Patrol (Earth-616)/Members,United Nations (Earth-616)/Members,Female Characters,Mutants (Homo superior),Public Identity Characters,Bob Layton/Creator,Keith Pollard/Creator,Single Characters,Height 6 ft. 11 in.
