	Creators,Al Ewing, Joe Bennett,First,Immortal Hulk #10(December, 2018), You did indeed take me all the way down... Past the country of Hell... To what lies below it. Hell actually seems quaint to me now. It had hierarchies and structures. Rulers and rules. It was only a place, like other places... And this is something else. Something deeper, at the bottom of reality, underneath everything... The concept of Hell. The foundation. The bedrock. The Below-Place. ,	Locations,Multiverse/Locations,Al Ewing/Creator,Joe Bennett/Creator,2018 Location Debuts,Brian Banner (Earth-616)/Quotes,Hell,Dimensions,
