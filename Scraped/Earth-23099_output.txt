	Creators,Jonathan Hickman, Simone Bianchi,First,New Avengers (Vol. 3) #13(December, 2013), The world changed overnight as the Great Machine caused cascading global Terrigenesis. Maximus, King of the Inhumans, had created the Well to induce the Great Change... And to usher in a new day for his expanding kingdom. The Royal Family watched as all the unchanged--The Lost Tribes and the Hidden Ones--Began to metamorphose as the Mist--The transformative fallout--Spread across the Globe. It should have been the start of a New Inhuman Age. Instead, it marked the end of the world. ,	Realities,Existing Realities,Jonathan Hickman/Creator,Simone Bianchi/Creator,2014 Reality Debuts,Earth-23099,Narrator/Quotes,Realities with Destroyed Earths,Earths Destroyed by the Black Priests,
