This symbiote belongs to nobody... nobody but me! ,—Maniac (Lee Price)[src],The symbiote that would be later known as the Mania[5] (alias Maniac) symbiote[3] was a clone of the Venom symbiote created by the Ararat Corporation from a piece of its tongue, intended to facilitate Bob's goal of exterminating all life on Earth.[6],Eventually bonding with Patricia Robertson, the clone intended to kill the original Venom, Eddie Brock. Thanks to Bob's actions, the Venom clone re-merged with the original symbiote, making Eddie more powerful than ever.[7] However, Bob's plans never came to pass, so eventually former soldier Flash Thompson bonded to the Venom symbiote to become Agent Venom, who was acting as a substitute gym teacher in Philadelphia. Jack O'Lantern tried to kill one of his students, Andi Benton, with poison gas. However, Flash bonded its symbiote's clone to her in order to protect her, unaware of its true nature.[5],Dubbing herself Mania, Andi was eventually possessed by the Hell-Mark when Flash had gone to live his own adventures with the Guardians of the Galaxy.[8] Despite that, Flash eventually returned to help her recover, and along his allies brought a elixir that served as a temporary cure to her condition.[9] Unfortunately, former Army Ranger Lee Price stole the Mania symbiote from her and dubbed himself Maniac.[3],	Characters,Resistance (Venomverse) (Earth-22249)/Members,Agender Characters,Symbiotes,Clones,Genetically Engineered,Secret Identity Characters,Daniel Way/Creator,Francisco Herrera/Creator,Single Characters,Variable Height,Variable Weight,Variable Eyes,No Hair,Black Skin,Prehensile Tongue,Fangs,Claws,Living Characters,Earth-616/Characters,2003 Character Debuts,Lee Price (Earth-616)/Quotes,Tentacles,White Eyes,Infobox Eyes Update Needed,Red Eyes,Venom Family,Clones of Venom Symbiote,Regeneration,Regenerative Durability,Superhuman Strength,Superhuman Speed,Organic Webbing,Wallcrawling,Superhuman Agility,Superhuman Stamina,Gestalt Characters,
