It means reality controls her. Imagination becomes the enemy. Structure disappears. Reality, eventually, as she knows it, starts to slip away. Elude her. Blur. Drama, conflict, tragedy. They become excuses to change the world to fit the image that she has for it. Anything she doesn't like, she can change. No matter how slight. People. Places. Things. Everything is hers to change. But every time she does that, every time she gives in to her desires, no matter how noble they may be... a little more of her slips away. She loses herself. Her reason. ,—Doctor Strange[src],Wanda Maximoff, also known as the Scarlet Witch, is a Romani Transian sorceress and twin sister of the speedster Quicksilver.[4][19][2] Once believed to have been mutant children of Magneto,[20] the twins are in truth orphans enhanced by the High Evolutionary at Mount Wundagore. The Scarlet Witch became a conduit of chaos magic, allowing her to shift probabilities and warp reality itself in the form of "hexes".[6][21] After being saved from an angry mob by Magneto, the Scarlet Witch and her brother joined the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to fight for Magneto's mutant supremacy cause.[4] Disagreeing with Magneto's ruthless approach, the twins left him and joined the super-heroic Avengers instead.[22],The Scarlet Witch was trained by Agatha Harkness in order to explore her naturally powerful magical abilities.[23] She also had in the demon lord of chaos Chthon an archnemesis.[24] As an Avenger, Maximoff fell in love with and married her synthezoid teammate, the Vision.[25] In order to form a family with her artificial husband, she used her abilities to create two twin boys,[26] but the spell was later broken, erasing the boys from existence,[27] a tragedy that was accompanied by her husband being dismantled.[28] The trauma of losing her family made her mentally vulnerable. After she attacked the Avengers twice, the group disassembled.[29][30] Subsequently, in a major display of her powers, the Scarlet Witch reshaped reality, making mutants the dominant lifeform on Earth ruling as the House of M, based on Magneto's wishes.[31] As the Avengers and the X-Men battled to restore reality, she uttered the words "No More Mutants", wiping out the super-abilities of most mutants in retaliation of Magneto's extremism. This action became known as the mutant decimation.[32],	Characters,Romany (Earth-616)/Members,Strange Academy (Earth-616)/Members,Avengers (Earth-616)/Members,Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)/Members,Avengers (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)/Members,Avengers (Hydra) (Earth-616)/Members,Axis (Avengers) (Earth-616)/Members,Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)/Members,Force Works (Earth-616)/Members,Secret Defenders (Earth-616)/Members,Lady Liberators (Earth-616)/Members,Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)/Members,Brides of Set (Earth-616)/Members,Queen’s Vengeance (Earth-398)/Members,Female Characters,Magicians,Mutates,Humans (Homo sapiens),Public Identity Characters,Stan Lee/Creator,Jack Kirby/Creator,Divorced Characters,Height 5 ft. 7 in.
