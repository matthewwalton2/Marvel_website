For real. My name is Miles Morales. I was bitten by a radioactive spider. And for like two days, I’ve been the one and only Spider-Man. I think you know the rest. I finished my essay. I saved a bunch of people. Got hit by a drone. I did this with my dad. Met my roommate finally. Slapped a sticker where my dad’s never going to find it. And when I feel alone, like no one understands what I’m going through, I remember my friends who get it. I never thought I'd be able to do any of this stuff, but I can. Anyone can wear the mask. You can wear the mask. If you didn't know that before, I hope you do now. Cause I’m Spider-Man. And I’m not the only one. Not by a long shot. ,	Characters,Spider-Gang (Earth-TRN700)/Members,Male Characters,Mutates,Humans (Homo sapiens),Secret Identity Characters,Jeff Pinkner/Creator,Scott Rosenberg/Creator,Kelly Marcel/Creator,Single Characters,Brown Eyes,Black Hair,Living Characters,Earth-TRN700/Characters,Americans,Adventurers,Vigilantes,Students,2018 Character Debuts,Miles Morales (Earth-TRN700)/Quotes,Morales Family,Brooklyn Visions Academy Student,Human/Spider Hybrids,Radioactive Spider-Powered,Camouflage,Electrokinesis,Energy Projection on contact,Leaping,Paralysis,Precogs,Superhuman Agility,Superhuman Durability,Superhuman Reflexes,Superhuman Speed,Superhuman Stamina,Superhuman Strength,Wallcrawling,Web-Slinging,			Languages			 ,Русский,
