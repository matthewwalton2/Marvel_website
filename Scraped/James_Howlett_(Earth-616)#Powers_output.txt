I'm the best there is at what I do, but what I do best isn't very nice. ,—Logan[src],Cursed with a berserker fury, the violent mutant known as Wolverine has a reputation both an outstanding superhero and as a lethal killer. Born as James Howlett to a wealthy Canadian family at the end of the 19th century, he was forced to abandon his family after the tragic manifestation of his bestial abilities of accelerated healing factor, keenly enhanced senses and bone claws in each hand. Adopting the name Logan, he wandered the world, living a long life filled with blood, war and betrayal,[71] having vile Sabretooth as his archenemy[72] and the Japanese warrior Ogun as his sensei.[73] Unfortunately, by acting as a lone wolf, Logan was an unwitting subject of the Weapon X program and had his bones coated in indestructible Adamantium, becoming an even more lethal asset.[74] Rescued and assisted by Mac and Heather Hudson, he joined Department H as a Canadian government operative known as the Wolverine.[75][76],Later, Logan was invited by Charles Xavier to join the X-Men, a team of heroes fighting for peace between humans and mutants.[77] Proving to be a challenging addition to the X-Men due to his aggressive behavior, Wolverine was constantly in conflict with his fellow teammate Cyclops. However, he has gradually grown fond of the X-Men, considering them to be his new family.[78] As a recurrent member of the X-Men, Wolverine has also become a noteworthy member of the Avengers.[79] Moreover, he has been tasked to run the secret mutant strike team known as X-Force to protect mutantkind's interests by employing lethal force.[80] Wolverine was also responsible for reforming the Jean Grey School after definitely parting ways with Cyclops and leading his own faction of X-Men.[81],	Characters,X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (Earth-616)/Members,Swordbearers of Krakoa (Earth-616)/Members,Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)/Members,Offer's Squad (Earth-616)/Members,Avengers (Earth-616)/Members,Murder Circus (Earth-616)/Members,New Avengers (Earth-616)/Members,X-Treme Sanctions Executive (Earth-616)/Members,Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)/Members,New Fantastic Four (Earth-616)/Members,Secret Defenders (Earth-616)/Members,Clan Yashida (Earth-616)/Members,Department H (Earth-616)/Members,Flight (Earth-616)/Members,Alpha Flight (Earth-616)/Members,Department K (Earth-616)/Members,Knights of Wundagore (Earth-616)/Members,Central Intelligence Agency (Earth-616)/Members,Team X (Earth-616)/Members,Weapon X (Earth-616)/Members,Canadian Army (Earth-616)/Members,Devil's Brigade (Earth-616)/Members,Logan's Mutant Team (Earth-616)/Members,Mighty (Earth-616)/Members,Landau, Luckman & Lake (Earth-616)/Members,Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)/Members,Black Dragon Tong (Earth-616)/Members,Triads (Earth-616)/Members,Yakuza (Earth-616)/Members,Hand (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Mutants (Homo superior),Public Identity Characters,Roy Thomas/Creator,Len Wein/Creator,John Romita Sr./Creator,Divorced Characters,Height 5 ft. 3 in.
