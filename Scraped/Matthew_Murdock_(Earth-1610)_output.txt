Because that is the only revenge that will mean anything. He doesn't believe in justice or the law. He doesn't believe he can be punished. He believes he is allowed to do what he is doing. And as much as I want to wrap my hands around his throat and watch him die... it won't mean anything. I want him in a court of law... to hear a jury of right-minded people... tell him he's evil and then put him away. ,	Characters,Knights (Earth-1610)/Members,Nelson and Murdock (Earth-1610)/Members,Male Characters,Mutates,Humans (Homo sapiens),Secret Identity Characters,Brian Michael Bendis/Creator,Bill Sienkiewicz/Creator,Single Characters,Height 6 ft. 0 in.
