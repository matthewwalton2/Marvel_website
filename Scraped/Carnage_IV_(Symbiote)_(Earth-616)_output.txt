This was a piece of the dragon my dad fought. The Grendel... it was just bonded to Cletus, so he made it all... crazy... ,—Dylan Brock[src],When Eddie Brock and the Tyrannosaurus symbiote killed the symbiote dragon called the Grendel, a small piece of it survived. That piece was collected by agents working for the Maker, who intended to merge it with a sample of Earth-1610's Venom symbiote in order to stabilize it. However, a cult dedicated to worship the symbiotes' elder god Knull stole and merged it with the decomposing corpse of Cletus Kasady, a serial killer who goes by the name of Carnage, in order to use him as a vessel for Knull. Unfortunately, while both Knull and the reanimated Cletus fought for control of the latter's body, the Grendel offshoot assimilated Scorn's trace remnants of symbiotes by ripping out her spine. Since some of those remnants were from the original Carnage symbiote, it overwrote the offshoot's memories and personality to that of the original Carnage symbiote. Having lost his connection to Knull, Cletus was now dedicated to restabilizing it and freeing Knull from his cage.[15][1],	Characters,Carnage's Hive (Earth-616)/Members,Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616)/Members,Cult of Knull (Earth-616)/Members,Agender Characters,Symbiotes,Deities,No Dual Identity Characters,Donny Cates/Creator,Ryan Stegman/Creator,Single Characters,Variable Height,Variable Weight,White Eyes,No Hair,Red Skin,Fangs,Winged Characters,Horns,Claws,Living Characters,Earth-616/Characters,Conquerors,2018 Character Debuts,Outdated Fields/Character,Yellow Eyes,Knull Worshipers,Cannibals,Demonic Form,Dragon Form,Spirits of Vengeance,Tentacles,Demigods,Clones of Carnage Symbiote,Gestalt Characters,Living Abyss,Blood-Based Powers,Electricity Weakness,Shapeshifters,Duplication,Shark Form,Wormholes,
