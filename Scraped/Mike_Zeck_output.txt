Zeck illustrated the Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars limited series in 1984. For this series, he designed a new black-and-white costume temporarily worn by Spider-Man. The plot that developed as a result of Spider-Man's acquisition of the costume led to the creation of the Spider-Man villain known as Venom.  ,In 1986, Zeck collaborated with writer Steven Grant on a Punisher miniseries which was later collected as The Punisher: Circle Of Blood and an original hardcover graphic novel of the character three years later.  ,Zeck illustrated the 1987 Spider-Man storyline "Kraven's Last Hunt", written by his Captain America collaborator J.M. DeMatteis, which is considered to be one of the quintessential stories in Spider-Man's history, as well as the definitive Kraven the Hunter storyline.  In 2004, Zeck's cover of Web of Spider-Man #32, which depicts Spider-Man escaping the grave into which he has been interred by Kraven, was recreated as a 12-inch tall resin diorama statue by Dynamic Forces.,Work History,152 subject(s) created by "Michael Zeck" ,233 work(s) where "Michael Zeck" created a cover,137 work(s) that "Michael Zeck" penciled,11 work(s) that "Michael Zeck" inked,6 work(s) that "Michael Zeck" colored,Images Drawn by Michael Zeck,226 covers drawn by "Michael Zeck" ,244 images penciled by "Michael Zeck" ,12 images inked by "Michael Zeck" ,20 images colored by "Michael Zeck" ,See Also,Links and References,http://www.mikezeck.com/,Mike Zeck in the DC Database,Footnotes,Like this?
