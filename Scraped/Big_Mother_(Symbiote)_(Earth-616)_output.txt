Thence upward ascendeth the surging of waters, wan to the welkin when the wind is stirring... The weathers unpleasing, till the air groweth gloomy... and the heavens lower." Your bards were wrong, their erroneous poems false. Lies. All lies. Centuries of hypocrisy. Fantasies. The time to hear the true tale, to sing the song of my son, is nearly upon us... upon you, my children. We shall rewrite your tomes. Correct your fictions. Tell the story as it was meant to be told. In a chorus of wails. Of screams. But first... I must strengthen myself. Must feed. Must continue to... create a family. ,	Characters,Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616)/Members,Symbiote Dragons,Cain's Clan (Earth-616)/Members,Federation of Women's Wrestling (Earth-616)/Members,Agender Characters,Symbiotes,Secret Identity Characters,Peter David/Creator,ChrisCross/Creator,Single Characters,Variable Height,Weight above 1000 lbs (453.59 kg),Yellow Eyes,No Hair,Red Skin,Winged Characters,Deceased Characters,Earth-616/Characters,Wrestlers,2001 Character Debuts,Outdated Fields/Character,Big Mother (Symbiote) (Earth-616)/Quotes,Shapeshifters,Flight,Mythological Figures,Dragon Form,Giant Monsters,Living Abyss,Knull Worshipers,Magicians,Fire Breath,Size Alteration,
