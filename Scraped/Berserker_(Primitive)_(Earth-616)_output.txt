Fleeing his pursuers, he escaped into "The Cave of Glowing Walls", an area feared by his enemies. Inside, he found the remains of those who had entered before him, but unlike the rest, he managed to go farther into the cave, growing weaker with each step. Eventually he stumbled down a cliff inside the cave but he emerged a few hours later, having gained immense powers and an insane fury. The first to fall before him were those who had vanquished his tribe. From there, he continued killing any who he came across, eventually being known as the Berserker.,Living Status,Alive,Reality,Earth-616,	Identity,Secret,Occupation,Conqueror, killer, supreme warrior of the galaxy,Base of Operations,Mobile,	Creators,Bob Budiansky, Danny Fingeroth, Gene Colan,First,Avengers #207(February, 1981),	Characters,Single Characters,Male Characters,Secret Identity Characters,Bob Budiansky/Creator,Danny Fingeroth/Creator,Gene Colan/Creator,Height 7-8 ft.
