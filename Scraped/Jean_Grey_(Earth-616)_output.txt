The time we spent in between - time spent alive, sharing, learning together... is all that makes life worth living. ,—Jean Grey[src],Jean Grey is a mutant with vast empathic and telepathic abilities that were traumatically awakened when as a child she witnessed her best friend's death. For years, Jean Grey was mentored by mutant specialist Professor Charles Xavier, a telepath himself. Eventually, she also developed telekinetic powers.[11] When Xavier opened a school for mutants in order to prepare his students to carry on his dream of peaceful coexistence between mutants and humans, Jean Grey was enrolled as the last student of his first class. As Marvel Girl, she became one of the original X-Men, a group that fight for a world that hates and fears mutants.[12],Jean Grey is intimately associated with the Phoenix, an immensely powerful cosmic entity.[13] After being corrupted by the Hellfire Club, Phoenix rose as the Dark Phoenix and caused immeasurable destruction. Jean Grey's conscience led the Phoenix to sacrifice herself to prevent further destruction.[14] Jean Grey's connection to the Phoenix, a force of destruction and rebirth, inflicted a number of deaths[15][7] and resurrections.[16][17] Upon her most recent return, Jean Grey permanently rejected the Phoenix and took the direction of a new X-Men team.[18],	Characters,X-Men (Earth-616)/Members,Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)/Members,X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (Jean Grey's) (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (Time-Displaced) (Earth-616)/Members,Hive (Poisons) (Earth-17952)/Members,X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)/Members,Clan Rebellion (Earth-4935)/Members,Muir Island X-Men (Earth-616)/Members,X-Factor (Earth-616)/Members,Twelve (Mutants) (Earth-616)/Members,Brides of Set (Earth-616)/Members,Female Characters,Mutants (Homo superior),Public Identity Characters,Stan Lee/Creator,Jack Kirby/Creator,Married Characters,Height 5 ft. 6 in.
