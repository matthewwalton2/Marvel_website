Howard, Roy Thomas, Barry Smith,First,Conan the Barbarian #4(April, 1971),Southeast of Hyperborea, descendants of a pre-cataclysmic nation founded Zamora.[8] The founding nation was a hybrid group called Zhemri,[7] but their descendants are called Zamorians[6][7] or Zamorans.[citation needed],Since time out of mind, Zamora has stood as a proud and independent nation. In more primitive days, the warlike Hybori could never quite conquer it, so they settled down to form kingdoms of their own. During Conan's times, Zamora stands poised uneasily, between the Hyboreans and the rising empire of Turan to the east. Thus, mercenary armies, with their dubious loyalty, are not allowed within its cities' walls, and are made to feel unwelcome even in the hinterlands.,	Locations,Earth-616/Locations,Robert E.
