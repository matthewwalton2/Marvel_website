	Creators,Brian Michael Bendis, Leinil Yu,First,New Avengers #35(October, 2007), We're going to organize. We're going to work together. We're going to help each other get what we want, when we want it. Because I know you're going sick of Ryker's and you're sick of the Raft--and you're sick of living in the shadows and wondering where the next nut will come from. Or worrying which costumed @##$$ is going to break down your door and ruin your life. But here's the new news... Captain America is dead. Nick Fury is gone. The heroes are fighting the heroes. And half of the heroes are running for their lives... While the other half aren't allowed to move unless Iron Man tells them to. Since Wilson Fisk was put out to pasture it's been even more chaotic for guys like us than it's ever been. There's no structure to any of it. I say we replace that chaos with something new. With us. ,	Teams,Secret Identity Teams,Brian Michael Bendis/Creator,Leinil Francis Yu/Creator,Active Teams,Earth-616/Teams,2007 Team Debuts,Parker Robbins (Earth-616)/Quotes,Criminal Organizations,Gangs,
