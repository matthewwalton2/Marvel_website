Let’s start at the beginning one last time. My name is Gwen Stacy. I was bitten by a radioactive spider. And for the last two years, I've been the one and only Spider-Woman. You guys know the rest. I joined a band. Saved my dad. I couldn’t save my best friend, Peter Parker. So now I save everyone else. And I don’t do friends anymore. Just to avoid any distractions. ,	Characters,Mary Janes (Earth-TRN702)/Members,Spider-Gang (Earth-TRN700)/Members,Female Characters,Mutates,Humans (Homo sapiens),Secret Identity Characters,Phil Lord/Creator,Christopher Miller/Creator,Rodney Rothman/Creator,Single Characters,Blue Eyes,Blond Hair,Living Characters,Earth-TRN702/Characters,Americans,Adventurers,Vigilantes,Students,Musicians,2018 Character Debuts,Gwendolyn Stacy (Earth-TRN702)/Quotes,Brooklyn Visions Academy Student,Human/Spider Hybrids,Interdimensional Travelers,Radioactive Spider-Powered,Precogs,Superhuman Agility,Superhuman Durability,Superhuman Speed,Superhuman Strength,Wallcrawling,Web-Slinging,Stacy Family,			Languages			 ,Русский,
