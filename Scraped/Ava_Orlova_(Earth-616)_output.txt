Aside from a lost and scarred little girl, who has nothing and no one? Is that all there is? Because it doesn't feel like enough. "Strong like an ox and sharp like a razor." That's what my mother would say. But I could be those things, can't I? Strong. Brave. Without needing anyone. As powerful as Natasha Romanoff -- but far less of a disappointment. I can almost see it now... The Red Widow. And this time, sestra, I'll be the one doing the saving. ,	Characters,Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)/Members,Black Widow Ops Program (Earth-616)/Members,Female Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),Secret Identity Characters,Margaret Stohl/Creator,Nico Leon/Creator,Single Characters,Green Eyes,Red Hair,Living Characters,Earth-616/Characters,Ukrainians,2015 Character Debuts,Ava Orlova (Earth-616)/Quotes,Spies,Weapons Expert,Fencing,Electrokinesis,
