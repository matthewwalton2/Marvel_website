Magneto, Savior of all Mutants, had gathered the survivors of the world's second Holocaust and brought them to his new kingdom. A place called Heaven, where all his angels would be safe...

Instead, it was soon to be no world at all. ,	Realities,Existing Realities,Jonathan Hickman/Creator,Simone Bianchi/Creator,2014 Reality Debuts,Earth-2319,Narrator/Quotes,Earths Destroyed by the Mapmakers,Realities with Destroyed Earths,Ages of Apocalypse,
