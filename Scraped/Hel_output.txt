	Creators,Stan Lee, Jack Kirby,First,Journey into Mystery #102(January, 1964), Hel is a world bound to the mind of its mistress and queen, Hela, Ruler of the Dead. The realm shifts by her will. Its laws are ancient, and her whims can twist those laws until they scream... but not until they break. As Valhalla is a realm of honor, and Faerie a realm of temptation... Hel is the realm of trials. Sometimes, Hel is a pit. Sometimes, Hel is a palace. Now, Hel is a puzzle box. It's not a place of sheer suffering, you ought to know. For the wicked, it is punishment. For the righteous, it is reward. For everyone else, it's pretty chill. No Taco Tuesdays, and no Wi-Fi, but, you know. Still pretty chill... ,—Sera[src],Hel (pronounced like the English word "Hell")[3] is a region of Niffleheim,[5] one of the Nine Realms. It is one of the many realms of death across the cosmos making it the final resting place for the dead for the Nine Realms. It is presided over by a fearsome goddess Hela. Occasionally, it’s also referred to as "Helheim".[1][2] The appearance and nature of the realm can be altered on the whim and wishes of it's Queen. Sometimes, Hel is a pit, sometimes is a palace and other time a puzzle box.[6] It is not just a place of punishment, it is simply a resting place for the dead. While parts of it, like Elysium[7] and Valhalla,[8] are afterlife paradises, other parts are seen as dark and gloomy. It may be reached by taking a road known as the Helway, which begins with a cave called Gnipahellir.[9],	Locations,Earth-616/Locations,Stan Lee/Creator,Jack Kirby/Creator,Niffleheim,Regions,1964 Location Debuts,Sera (Earth-616)/Quotes,Hell,Realm of Death,
