Class is in session. Ever hear of "The Butterfly Effect"? How going back in time and stepping on one bug could wipe out the present? Just imagine, then, what I'm about to do to the future. Heard about how Earth's bumblebee population took a hit? How it might destroy our planet's entire ecosystem? That was me. I did it for a lark. Just to see if I could. This, however, this is work. And after months of bedbug outbreaks... (You can thank me later, Manhattan)... I believe I've finally cooked up the perfect batch. They're ready. C'mon, babies... Time to leave the nest. Or should I say nests? Thousand of locations around the city. Can you hear them? Scurrying? The pitter patter of their little feet? Nom. Nom. Nom. Good night, New York. Sleep tight. Have a bite. It's on me. My name is Miles Warren. And you... All of you... You are my science experiment. ,	Characters,New U Technologies (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Mutates,Humans (Homo sapiens),Known to Authorities Identity Characters,Stan Lee/Creator,Steve Ditko/Creator,Gerry Conway/Creator,Ross Andru/Creator,Widowed Characters,Height 5 ft. 10 in.
