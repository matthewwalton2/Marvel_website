He was hired as a staff colorist by Timely Comics, working under head colorist Jon D'Agostino. In 1951, Goldberg himself became the manager of the coloring department. He colored almost every cover published by Atlas Comics, and many of the interior stories. [1],Besides coloring, Goldberg started penciling stories for Atlas. His early credits mostly include horror stories. He was a regular staff member of the company's regular Bullpen, but the entire bullpen was fired in 1957. Goldberg started work as a freelance colorist, while also studying storyboarding at the  School of Visual Arts. [2],In the 1960s, Goldberg was hired as a freelance-colorist by Marvel Comics. While mostly uncredited, he was actually the main colorist of the company for much of the decade. Comic book historians credit him for the color designs for a number of Marvel characters, such as the Fantastic Four, the Hulk, and Spider-Man. [3] Other known, but uncredited, Marvel colorists from the same era were George Roussos, Marie Severin, and Jim Steranko.[4],Goldberg also found work as a penciler and inker in Marvel's humor titles, which were featuring teenagers and career girls. He took over the series featuring Millie Collins and Patsy Walker, and redesigned the characters. At the time these series were turning from slapstick titles to romantic comedies and adventures, and required more serious artwork than before. [5] Goldberg also contributed to the plot of the stories. [6],Goldberg may have penciled more Marvel stories than he was credited for. He was freelancing for various companies and felt that signing his work would mark him as a "Marvel" artist and create complications. Comic book historians have noted that some stories in Goldberg's style were credited to Sol Brodsky. Brodsky was the production manager of Marvel at the time, and may have simply signed on uncredited work by Goldberg. [7],Goldberg stopped freelancing for Marvel in 1969, when he was hired by DC Comics to work on their own teenage humor titles. He worked for DC Comics until 1972, and then he was hired on a permanent basis by Archie Comics. The publisher specialized in teenage humor titles, and as a freelancer Goldberg had penciled various stories for them. Goldberg was one of Archie Comics' main artists from the 1970's to 2010. He worked with most of the company's leading characters and penciled various high-profile stories. [8],In the 1980s, Goldberg penciled some issues for DC Comics again. Following his retirement from Archie Comics, Goldberg created some covers for Marvel Comics and IDW Publishing. He also penciled a 2011 story for Bongo Comics. In 2012, he started producing graphic novels based on licensed characters. In 2013, Goldberg was involved in an automobile accident and was injured. He eventually recovered from his injuries. In 2014, Goldberg suffered a stroke and was hospitalized. Two weeks later, he died in the hospital. He was 82 years old. [9],In the 1960's, Goldberg married Pauline Minsky. The couple had at least three children. His son Stephen Goldberg went on to serve as the media director of an advertising agency. His other son Bennett Goldberg went on to become a graphic designer. Heidi Goldberg, his only known daughter, was murdered in 1984. Goldberg was greatly affected by her murder and joined an organization called "Parents of Murdered Children".
