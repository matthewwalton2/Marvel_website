Little girls, all alone. Hydra gave us a home. Eight great houses. Twelve girls to a house. And in the end, the most determined... the most ambitious... the most aggressive... That girl would be the Viper. All it cost was everything. I have been married to a man I hated. I could not marry the man I loved. I betrayed him. And I was betrayed in turn. Then I was murdered. Death, welcome and well - deserved. But Hydra, it seems, will never be done with me... To live, and die and live again. ,	Characters,J.A.N.U.S. (Earth-616)/Members,Femme Fatales (Earth-616)/Members,Hydra (Earth-616)/Members,High Council of Hydra (Earth-616)/Members,H.A.M.M.E.R.
