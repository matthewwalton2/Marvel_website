	Creators,Jonathan Hickman, Esad Ribić,First,Secret Wars #2(May, 2015), The Bar Sinister is ruled not by an individual but a virus. A self-replicating tribe of genetic jerks.

He needs slaves. ,	Locations,Earth-15513/Locations,Jonathan Hickman/Creator,Esad Ribić/Creator,Battleworld (Latverion),Locales,2015 Location Debuts,Matthew Murdock (Earth-21919)/Quotes,Islands,Fictional Islands,Mister Sinister Bases,Earth-21919,Earth-616,Earth,Oceania (Earth),Pacific Ocean,Krakoa,Krakoan Habitats,
