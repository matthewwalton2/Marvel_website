You put on that badge and carry that gun because you know if you don't someone who shouldn't will. When I put on this mask, I only did it -- Because it freed me from responsibility. I thought I was special. And Peter Parker died because he tried to follow my example. I have to take responsibility for that. To make his death mean something. But I can't do it in a jail cell. This mask is my badge now. If I don't define what it means... monsters like this will. This is where I'm needed most. ,	Characters,Mary Janes (Earth-65)/Members,Order of the Web (Earth-616)/Members,Spider-Army (Multiverse)/Members,Ozcorp (Earth-22191)/Members,Hand (Earth-65)/Members,Web-Warriors (Earth-001)/Members,Female Characters,Mutates,Humans (Homo sapiens),Public Identity Characters,Jason Latour/Creator,Robbi Rodriguez/Creator,Single Characters,Height 5 ft. 5 in.
