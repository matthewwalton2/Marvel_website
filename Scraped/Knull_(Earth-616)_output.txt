I am Knull. Lord of the Abyss. God of the Symbiotes. The darkness inside of you? That darkness bows to me. I am the Void. ,—Knull[src],Knull is a eldritch god of darkness and the creator of the symbiotes. He is the main antagonist of Venom Vol. 4 and the King in Black event.,Born from the primordial void that existed between the sixth and seventh cosmos,[18] Knull claims dominion over the void and to be its avatar, but while he is a God of the Void he is not the primordial darkness itself.[14] Awakened by the Light when the Celestials invaded his kingdom of darkness, he created the first symbiote in the form of a sword and decapitated a Celestial. He used the head's divine power to refine the blade, creating a metaphysical connection between the primordial symbiote and the slain cosmic god - which would be the source of most of Knull's tremendous power.[19] Waging war against the Light, Knull became a legendary figure of divine terror but eventually found himself stranded on a nameless planet after an inhabitant stole his blade and unwittingly followed in his footsteps. Experimenting with his powers, Knull discovered he could create amorphous parasites from the darkness he controls and merge them with "lesser creatures", so he decided to use this as a way to corrupt the Light.,Establishing himself as the nexus of the Hive he created, Knull proceeded to conquer worlds and form a fleet of Symbiote Dragons. When two of his dragons arrived on Earth, the young God of Thunder Thor Odinson struck down one of them and severed Knull's connection to all of the other Symbiote Dragons, who dissipated into countless individual symbiotes, while the other would seemingly be killed by Thor in a mid-air battle, its body plummeting to the depths of the North Sea. Merging with the closest hosts they could find, the Hive was now infected with concepts of honor and nobility, so the symbiotes turned on Knull and trapped him at the core of the throneworld, rebranding themselves "Klyntar" out of their word for "cage".[12][20],	Characters,Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Elder Gods,Deities,No Dual Identity Characters,Donny Cates/Creator,Ryan Stegman/Creator,Single Characters,Height above 8 ft.
