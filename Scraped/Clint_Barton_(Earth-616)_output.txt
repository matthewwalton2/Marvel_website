I'm on a team with super-humans. And one god, in case you've forgotten. Even you... well, you climb walls really well. The training is the only thing that makes me special. And if I'm not special, then none of this is worth it. I gave up a lot for this life. I could have been happy with Mockingbir-- Bobbi. We could have had a good, simple life. But I wanted to play with the big boys. And if I miss, it means I'm just another dude with a bow. It means I've been fooling myself this whole time. And that's why I never miss. ,—Hawkeye[src],	Characters,Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)/Members,New York City Police Department (Earth-616)/Members,Deadpool Task Force (Earth-616)/Members,Underground (Secret Empire) (Earth-616)/Members,New Avengers (A.I.M.)
