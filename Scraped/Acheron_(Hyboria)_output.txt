For twenty five centuries, purple towered Python, crown city of the Acheronian Empire, held court in a reign of terror. Three thousand years after its fall the races of the Hyborian world would only dare to speak of ancient Acheron in hushed tones of whispered fear. The legends of necromancy, and legends of treasure long buried and all but forgotten. But of all that were told, none had the power to terrify and entice as that of... The Witch Queen of Acheron. ,—The Nemedian Chronicles[src],Acheron was an ancient and now fallen civilization of early mankind,[5] a sorcerer-riddled[6][7] ancient evil nation[8][9] of purple towered cities.[8],The empire thrived from 15,500 BC to 13,000 BC,[10] a period known as the Age of Acheron.[11] over a span of twenty-five centuries.[1],	Locations,Defunct Locations,Earth-616/Locations,Robert E.
