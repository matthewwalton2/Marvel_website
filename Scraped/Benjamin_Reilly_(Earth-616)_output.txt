After making amends with Peter, Ben fought alongside him as the Scarlet Spider.[4] For a brief time, Ben and Peter were tricked by Norman Osborn via Seward Trainer to believe Ben was the real Peter Parker. Peter left New York with his wife Mary Jane Watson, leaving Ben to pick up the mantle of Spider-Man.[24] During a subsequent confrontation against Osborn as the Green Goblin, Ben was impaled and died in Peter's arms, also discovering that Peter being the clone was a fabrication.[25],	Characters,Beyond Corporation (Multiverse)/Members,Midnight Sons (Earth-616)/Members,Space Friends (Earth-616)/Members,New Warriors (Earth-616)/Members,New U Technologies (Earth-616)/Members,Superior Spider-Army (Earth-928)/Members,Male Characters,Mutates,Humans (Homo sapiens),Clones,Genetically Engineered,Secret Identity Characters,Gerry Conway/Creator,Ross Andru/Creator,Single Characters,Height 5 ft. 10 in.
