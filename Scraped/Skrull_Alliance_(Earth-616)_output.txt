	Creators,Al Ewing, Humberto Ramos,First,Incoming #1(December, 2019), My people! You are Kree and you are Skrull! Orphans of Skrullos! Orphans of Hala! Your war has run hot and cold for a thousand years! Since the dawn of civilization as we know it! Your conflict created the Star-Sword I hold! Your conflict created me! I am the living embodiment of your war! And today -- I call an end to it! By prophecy and destiny -- by my decree and your acclaim -- the twin empires are one! We are one people -- our people! I am Dorrek VIII, the once and future King of Space! I am your emperor -- and I say we are no longer Kree or Skrull! We are the Alliance -- and in all the galaxy, we have only one enemy -- this enemy! Make ready the fleet! Join our forces as one! We journey to the Sol System! The final war begins now! ,	Organizations,Public Identity Organizations,Al Ewing/Creator,Humberto Ramos/Creator,Active Organizations,Earth-616/Organizations,2019 Organization Debuts,Theodore Altman (Earth-616)/Quotes,Kree Organizations,Skrull Organizations,Empires and Civilizations,Interplanetary Organizations,Monarchies,
