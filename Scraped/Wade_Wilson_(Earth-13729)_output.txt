For God's sake, stop trying to kill each other! All this fighting, it's too much, even for me. I can't do this anymore. You wanna know how screwed up things are in the future? Open your eyes! It's so screwed up, they made me an X-Man! So screwed up we had no choice but to travel back through time and try to change history. You guys... you guys don't want our future. Believe me. Some of you... really don't want our future. It's not like the old days, when we were always laughing, remember? Or at least, I was always laughing. Nobody laughs in the future. Must be all the funerals. The future sucks. And if you guys are just gonna make us go back there, then... well... then I guess I quit. My healing factor ain't what it used to be. So I think this might actually kill me. God, I hope so. Bury me in chimichangas. ,	Characters,Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-13729)/Members,X-Men (Earth-13729)/Members,Male Characters,Mutates,Humans (Homo sapiens),Public Identity Characters,Brian Michael Bendis/Creator,Arthur Adams/Creator,Single Characters,White Eyes,Bald,Living Characters,Earth-13729/Characters,Canadians,Adventurers,2013 Character Debuts,Wade Wilson (Earth-13729)/Quotes,Wilson Family,Battle of the Atom casualties,Fencing,Formerly Deceased,Regeneration,Scarred,Interdimensional Travelers,Time Travelers,
