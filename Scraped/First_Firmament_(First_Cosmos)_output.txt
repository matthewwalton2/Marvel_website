Your own systems have been corrupted. Turned against you. They will devour you from the inside out. And I will absorb what scraps are left of you, Eternity. And all will be as it was, long ago. Before your foul kind. Before the Multiverses. Eighth and seventh... and sixth... and fifth... and back and back... dying and being born, over and over. Like filthy little organisms. We will return to a saner time. When there was but one cosmos. One universe. One reality. One totality. When there was only I. I am the First Firmament. And soon... I will be the last. ,—First Firmament[src],	Characters,Agender Characters,Abstract Entities,Cosmic Beings,Known to Authorities Identity Characters,Grant Morrison/Creator,Al Ewing/Creator,Travel Foreman/Creator,Single Characters,Blue Eyes,No Hair,Living Characters,First Cosmos/Characters,2001 Character Debuts,First Firmament (First Cosmos)/Quotes,
