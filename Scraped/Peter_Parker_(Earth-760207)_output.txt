Some would hold a grudge against me. And some, who tried to give me so much...only to lose everything. I don't want to cause any more pain here. I can't live with that burden any longer. So it's time for me to say: Goodbye, Spider-Man. ,	Characters,Daily Bugle (Earth-760207)/Members,Male Characters,Mutates,Humans (Homo sapiens),No Dual Identity Characters,Morgan Gendel/Creator,Single Characters,Hazel Eyes,Brown Hair,Living Characters,Earth-760207/Characters,Americans,Adventurers,Vigilantes,Students,2003 Character Debuts,Peter Parker (Earth-760207)/Quotes,Parker Family,Human/Spider Hybrids,Organic Webbing,Radioactive Spider-Powered,Web-Slinging,Wallcrawling,Superhuman Strength,Superhuman Speed,Superhuman Reflexes,Superhuman Agility,Modern-Age Characters,Retired Characters,
