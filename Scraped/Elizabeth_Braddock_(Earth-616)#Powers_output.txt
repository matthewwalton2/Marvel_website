Because pain goes away. Just like this hurt will. So just remember -- all pain is only temporary, okay? No hurt lasts forever. ,—Betsy Braddock[src],Elizabeth "Betsy" Braddock is the daughter of Sir James Braddock, a champion from the Otherworld.[46] While her younger twin brother, Brian, became the warrior known as Captain Britain, Betsy developed mutant telepathic powers. By serving in S.T.R.I.K.E. Psi Division, her path as a secret agent crossed with her brother's super-hero activities.[47] She acted as an ally of her brother in several conflicts and even adopted the Captain Britain mantle.[48] After being blinded by the Slaymaster, Braddock stood down as Captain Britain,[49] only to be captured and to have her sight restored by Mojo and Spiral.[5] Rescued by the New Mutants and the X-Men, Braddock joined the ranks of the latter as Psylocke.[16],As a member of the X-Men, Psylocke experienced unimaginable adventures. Her life got unexpectedly twisted when her body was switched with Kwannon, an assassin ninja.[43][50] Freed by Wolverine, Psylocke returned to the X-Men having to cope with the experience of being stuck in another woman's body. For years, she was a loyal soldier to the X-Men, collaborating with different squadrons and paying the ultimate price when she was slain by the villain Vargas.[51] Resurrected by her older brother, Jamie,[52] Psylocke resumed her adventurous lifestyle by accompanying the X-Men and other groups, such as the multiversal Exiles[53] and the lethally destructive X-Force.[54],	Characters,Excalibur (Earth-616)/Members,Captain Britain Corps (Multiverse)/Members,Swordbearers of Krakoa (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (Earth-616)/Members,Department X (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (Magneto's) (Earth-616)/Members,X-Force (Earth-616)/Members,X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)/Members,Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)/Members,X-Club (Earth-616)/Members,Sisterhood of Mutants (Earth-616)/Members,Exiles (Multiverse)/Members,X-Treme Sanctions Executive (Earth-616)/Members,X-Treme X-Men (Earth-616)/Members,Hand (Earth-616)/Members,Hellfire Club (Earth-616)/Members,Special Tactical Reserve for International Key Emergencies (Earth-616)/Members,S.T.R.I.K.E.
