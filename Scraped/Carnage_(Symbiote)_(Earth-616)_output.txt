The spawn bonded to Cletus through a wound in his hand, merging with his blood and becoming red-and-black in color.[4][5] Dubbing himself Carnage, Cletus became a deadly recurring enemy to both Spider-Man and Venom.[6],	Characters,Agender Characters,Symbiotes,No Dual Identity Characters,David Michelinie/Creator,Mark Bagley/Creator,Single Characters,White Eyes,No Hair,Red Skin,Prehensile Tongue,Tentacles,Fangs,Claws,Living Characters,Earth-616/Characters,Terrorists,1991 Character Debuts,Outdated Fields/Character,Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)/Quotes,Insanity,Venom Family,Duplication,Magic Weakness,Magic-Based Mutates,Fire Weakness,Regeneration,Superhuman Strength,Shapeshifters,Technopaths,Empaths,Blood-Based Powers,Telepaths,Goblin Formula,Liquid Form,Formerly Deceased,
