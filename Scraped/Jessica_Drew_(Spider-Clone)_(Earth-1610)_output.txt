And that's what we have in common-- Men of science, who don't give a damn about anything but themselves, messed with the natural order of all things... And that's why we have a Hulk and you and me and Captain America and mutants and pretty much every other problem we have today. I wasn't ready to talk about this because it's hard to say out loud. It's hard to admit that I'm-- I'm not a real person. I don't have a mother or father. I'm not Peter Parker. I'm... this thing. It's hard to-- to process myself let alone get you to. I have years of Peter Parker's childhood memories rolling around in my head... And time has gone by, and those memories have faded, and my feelings about my connection to him have faded and--- And I've become this other thing. I'm not Peter Parker. I'm not Peter Parker. I'm not even a boy. I'm Jessica Drew. ,	Characters,Young Ultimates (Earth-1610)/Members,Ultimates (Earth-1610)/Members,Web-Warriors (Earth-001)/Members,Spider-Army (Multiverse)/Members,Web-Warriors (Earth-13)/Members,Superior Spider-Army (Earth-928)/Members,Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate (Earth-1610)/Members,Roxxon Brain Trust (Earth-1610)/Members,Central Intelligence Agency (Earth-1610)/Members,Federal Bureau of Investigation (Earth-1610)/Members,Female Characters,Mutates,Humans (Homo sapiens),Clones,Genetically Engineered,Known to Authorities Identity Characters,Brian Michael Bendis/Creator,Mark Bagley/Creator,Single Characters,Height 5 ft. 5 in.
