	First,Ultimate End #1(May, 2015), This is not the way the world is supposed to be. this wasn't the way the world was created. This -- this is a patchwork quilt of madness so madness can rule over it. The world you are living in now -- it was constructed using cosmic forces way beyond us. This isn't what New York is. Our dimensions were -- they were thrown on top of each other on purpose. We didn't do this. Man didn't do this. This was done to us. This is a zoo. A prison. This is a circus of -- terror and confusion built specifically to torture and punish everyone who has ever crossed its maker. And the real punishment is: ignorance. You would know if the world was ever different. You -- you were all put here to specifically to beat each other... to stomp on each other... to murder each other. Everyone here... We, all of us, have one enemy in common and he finally found a way to get at all of us. He is not your god. He is not your ruler. He is a mad scientist and dictator. He is just a man who has found a way to make you believe he is your god. But he isn't. And he never was. Doctor Doom is just a man. A broken, angry rage monster who finally got the power he needed to remake the world in his own image. He finally found the power to punish his enemies and rule over everyone. And he created this part of the world to punish you. He plucked you up and dropped you here to torture each other. To fight a fight with no winners and losers. With no memory of a better time and a better world. 'Let alone two better worlds. Doom is not god. He's just-- He's just Doctor Doom. And he won. ,	Locations,Earth-15513/Locations,Location Creators Needed,2015 Location Debuts,Battleworld (Latverion),Miles Morales (Earth-1610)/Quotes,
