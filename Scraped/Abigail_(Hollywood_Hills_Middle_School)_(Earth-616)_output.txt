Getting old is dangerous. Life doesn't get any safer than were we are right now... Thirteen. [...] We have everything that we want-- we're young, we're strong. We're old enough to understand everything. And young enough not to have to worry about it all. We don't ever have to get married. We don't have to get a job. I'm never going to have to worry about my period. I'll never get cramps! We can be kids forever, Molly. We can be girls. ,	Characters,Female Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),No Dual Identity Characters,Rainbow Rowell/Creator,Kris Anka/Creator,Single Characters,Green Eyes,Auburn Hair,Living Characters,Earth-616/Characters,Americans,2018 Character Debuts,Abigail (Hollywood Hills Middle School) (Earth-616)/Quotes,Multilingual,
