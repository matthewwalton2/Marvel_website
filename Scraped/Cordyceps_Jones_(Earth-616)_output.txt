He's not like you and me. You ever hear about that fungus that takes over ants? It starts out as a spore on the breeze...then it gets into an ant, and it lodges in his teeny tiny little brain. And it grows. And while it's growing, it makes Mr. Ant climb -- higher, right to the top of the nearest plant. Where the fungus can spore again. Doesn't end too well for the ant. And that Cordyceps. He's not a humanoid -- he's a spore. A fungus, taking over host bodies and making them climb, right to the top. ,—Deadpool[src],	Characters,Male Characters,No Dual Identity Characters,Al Ewing/Creator,Adam Gorham/Creator,Variable Height,Variable Weight,Variable Eyes,Variable Hair,Living Characters,Earth-616/Characters,2017 Character Debuts,Wade Wilson (Earth-616)/Quotes,Advanced Longevity,Crimelords,
