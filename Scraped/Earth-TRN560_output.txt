	Creators,Garth Ennis, Howard Chaykin,First,Punisher (Vol. 7) #50(October, 2007), The worst dream of all is the one that doesn't end in Central Park. The kids got sick. We didn't go that day. Now we live in Ditmas Park, and our children and their children come to visit. Our home fills up with voices. Kids laugh, or sulk, or query the injustice of finishing their greens. Parents struggle for control, or just to hear their voices heard above the tumult. I'm old and fat and slow. It's perfect. ,	Realities,Temporary Reality Numbers,Garth Ennis/Creator,Howard Chaykin/Creator,2007 Reality Debuts,Earth-TRN560,Frank Castle (Earth-200111)/Quotes,Realities Manifested in Dreams,
