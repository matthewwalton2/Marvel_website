He ended up dying next to a burning car in the desert between Vegas and Reno. He was my father. I was with him that time, also. But death wasn't the end for dad, just the terrible beginning. There was this cosmic entity named Kronos who needed a champion to keep Thanos in line. He grabbed my dad's soul and used it to animate his hero. So pop became the lumbering behemoth known as Drax the Destroyer. I guess even back then part of me still loved the guy. Didn't stop me, though, from killing him a second time. ,	Characters,Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)/Members,West Spiral Arm Guardians (Earth-616)/Members,Avengers (Earth-616)/Members,Defenders (Earth-616)/Members,Vaughn Security Systems (Earth-616)/Members,Infinity Watch (Earth-616)/Members,United Front (Earth-616)/Members,Knowhere Corps (Earth-616)/Members,Female Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),Secret Identity Characters,William Blake Everett/Creator,Mike Friedrich/Creator,George Tuska/Creator,Single Characters,Height 6 ft. 3 in.
