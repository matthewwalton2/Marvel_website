I know. As I've grown older, I've realized that I do not have the character to be both good and great at the same time. But you do, Reed...

Be a better father... Reed... be a better man. ,	Characters,Brotherhood of the Shield (Earth-616)/Members,Future Foundation (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),No Dual Identity Characters,John Byrne/Creator,Widowed Characters,Height 6 ft. 2 in.
