And it's the hardest part because sometimes to protect what you love, you have to walk away from it. ,—She-Hulk[src],Jennifer Walters is a talented lawyer and the cousin of Bruce Banner, the Hulk. After being shot by a mobster and seriously injured, she was saved by a blood transfusion from Bruce, and his gamma-irradiated blood mutated Jennifer into the She-Hulk, kicking off her adventuring career.[1],Jen wasn't as strong as her cousin, but she maintained her intelligence as She-Hulk, soon learning to control her transformations and even embracing her green form.[62][63][51] Throughout the years, Jen fought for justice in court and on the streets,[64][65] developing great rivalries[66] and friendships,[60][67] and growing to become a respected leader.[68][44] She worked for the District Attorney[69] and also fought crime as a member of countless teams, namely the World-famous Avengers and Fantastic Four.[70][71],	Characters,Avengers (Earth-616)/Members,Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616)/Members,Empyre (Earth-616)/Members,A-Force (Earth-616)/Members,Law Offices of Jennifer Walters, PLLC (Earth-616)/Members,Mighty Avengers (Cage) (Earth-616)/Members,Future Foundation (Earth-616)/Members,Fantastic Four (Earth-616)/Members,Fearsome Four (Earth-616)/Members,Defenders (Initiative) (Earth-616)/Members,Incredible Hulks (Earth-616)/Members,Lady Liberators (Earth-616)/Members,Freeman Bonding Incorporated (Earth-616)/Members,Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway (Earth-616)/Members,Hulkbusters (S.H.I.E.L.D.)
