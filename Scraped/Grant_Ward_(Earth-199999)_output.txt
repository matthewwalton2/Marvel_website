S3E10(December 8, 2015), I'm not looking for mercy or absolution. I just want you to know, I've been where you are right now. Filled with rage, wanting revenge... I chose Hydra for petty, personal, selfish reasons... for a father figure, for vengeance... for closure. But what I saw today gave my life meaning. For the first time ever, I have a sense of satisfaction that I never experienced when I was seeking revenge. ,	Characters,Hydra (Earth-199999)/Members,Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-199999)/Members,Male Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),No Dual Identity Characters,Joss Whedon/Creator,Jed Whedon/Creator,Maurissa Tancharoen/Creator,Single Characters,Height 6 ft. 3 in.
