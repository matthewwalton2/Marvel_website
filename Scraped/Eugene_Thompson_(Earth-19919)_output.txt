Gage, Paco Diaz,First,Death,Spider-Island #1(July, 2015),Spider-Island #5(October, 2015), I've been to war. Lost men before...way too many. Thought nothing could be possibly worse. But at least we were fighting an enemy then. Soldiers aren't naive. Even in combat, we realize the guys we're fighting have families and hopes and fears just like us. But at least they know what they're doing. These Spider-People? They could be cops, or priests, or kindergarten teachers. Our friends and neighbors, lovers, famly members, only fighting because their Queen commands it. We can't hold back. All we can do is keep a tally of every piece of our soul we lose... and make the Queen pay for it. ,	Characters,Resistance (Earth-19919)/Members,Male Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),Known to Authorities Identity Characters,Christos N.
