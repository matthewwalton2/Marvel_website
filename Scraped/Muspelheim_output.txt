In the northern part of Ginnungagap lay the intense cold of Niffleheim, and to the southern part lay the equally intense heat of Muspelheim. The cosmogonic process began when the effulgence of the two met in the middle of Ginnungagap. This created the Nine Realms.[8],Politics and Leadership,	Locations,Earth-616/Locations,Stan Lee/Creator,Jack Kirby/Creator,Archipelago of Anguish and Redemption,Ten Realms,Planets,1963 Location Debuts,The Nine Realms (Maelstrom),
