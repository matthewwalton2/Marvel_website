I know you. Not just who you are, but what you're capable of once you grow tired of hiding here in 'Mayberry'. That much anger, that much hate, can't stay hidden forever. You try... and it will burn you up inside. Now, though, they say you're not the man you once were, that your powers are weakened. But I'm betting you still remember all those people you couldn't help, even when your abilities were at their peak. I don't think your powers have anything to do with what you were. What you still are. The truth is, the clock is ticking. It's just a matter of time before you cut loose again, in a big way. And you know it. You know what they say about idle hands, don't you? You just need something to keep those hands of yours busy. ,	Characters,Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)/Members,Hellfire Club (Earth-616)/Members,Female Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),Cyborgs,No Dual Identity Characters,Cullen Bunn/Creator,Gabriel Hernandez Walta/Creator,Single Characters,Green Eyes,Red Hair,Living Characters,Earth-616/Characters,Americans,Businesspeople,2014 Character Debuts,Briar Raleigh (Earth-616)/Quotes,Telepathic Immunity,
