And Lord knows, kids like Henry need a hero. Courageous, self-sacrificing people. Setting examples for all of us. Everybody loves a hero. People line up for them, cheer them, scream their names. And years later, they'll tell how they stood in the rain for hours just to get a glimpse of the one who taught them how to hold on a second longer. I believe there's a hero in all of us. That keeps us honest, gives us strength, makes us noble, and finally allows us to die with pride. Even though sometimes, we have to be steady, and give up the thing we want the most. Even our dreams. Spider-Man did that for Henry and he wonders where he's gone. He needs him. ,	Characters,Female Characters,No Dual Identity Characters,David Koepp/Creator,Widowed Characters,Green Eyes,White Hair,Living Characters,Earth-96283/Characters,Americans,2002 Character Debuts,Maybelle Parker (Earth-96283)/Quotes,Parker Family,Reilly Family,
