I don't have a quote unquote Jewish-sounding name. I don't look or sound Jewish, whatever that looks or sounds like... So if you didn't know I was Jewish, you might not know... unless I told you. Same goes for my mutation. I don't have to wear a visor or have blue fur all over me. I can walk around. Just a young woman of the world. But... I'm not. ,—Kitty Pryde[src],Kitty Pryde is a Jewish mutant with versatile phasing abilities which allow her to move through solid matter. After her powers first manifested, Pryde was approached both by Emma Frost, the White Queen of the Hellfire Club, and the X-Men, a mutant super-hero group. Realizing Frost had vile intentions as she captured and tortured the X-Men, Pryde demonstrated immense bravery and freed the X-Men.[28] As Sprite, she became the X-Men's youngest member by enrolling at the Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters.[4],Proving to be a controversial but invigorating addition to the team, Pryde had her life completely guided by her tenure with the X-Men, who became her second family. After being brainwashed by the swordmaster known as Ogun, Pryde connected herself with darker aspects of her soul, adopting the codename Shadowcat for years.[29] She was also a founding member of the British-based mutant team known as Excalibur, experiencing an exceptional adolescence, by growing up as a super-hero.[30] As an adult, she returned to the X-Men[31] and, as a mutant super-hero, she had a great impact in the world, such as sacrificing her freedom to save Earth,[32] becoming the headmistress of the Xavier's School,[33] and leading the X-Men.[34],	Characters,Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)/Members,Marauders (Pryde) (Earth-616)/Members,Hellfire Club (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (Earth-616)/Members,Hounds (Earth-811)/Members,Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (Time-Displaced) (Earth-616)/Members,Excalibur (Earth-616)/Members,Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)/Members,Murder Circus (Earth-616)/Members,Paladins (Earth-616)/Members,New Mutants (Earth-616)/Members,Knights of Wundagore (Earth-616)/Members,X-Tracts (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)/Members,Female Characters,Mutants (Homo superior),Public Identity Characters,Chris Claremont/Creator,John Byrne/Creator,Single Characters,Height 5 ft. 6 in.
