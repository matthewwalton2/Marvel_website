Bounding through a line of wine, women and song... And without a care in the world. But is that truly the case, however? In this, I wonder... I wonder if you see our faces every time you close your eyes? Or if our deaths haunt your every waking moment...even after all these years? I wonder if what the world sees of you is but a mask...and you, happy-go-lucky Hercules, are anything but. After all...nobody gets that drunk. Am I right to wonder these things, my husband... Are our children right? There's no need to answer. You've come here for our forgiveness...you have it. Your labor is complete. ,	Characters,Female Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),No Dual Identity Characters,Frank Tieri/Creator,Mark Texeira/Creator,Married Characters,Deceased Characters,Earth-616/Characters,Killed by Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616),Greeks,Monarchs,2005 Character Debuts,Megara (Earth-616)/Quotes,Hercules Family,Greek Religion,Theban Royal Family,Mythological Figures,
