I'm Death's Head. A peacekeeping operative from your far future. I've fought giant robots, partied with game players and aliens. Life was sweet. Until some psycho called Evelyn Necker built Minion in the year 2020. Minion hunted down the toughest killers across time and space and downloaded their abilities. I was personality #106. Only I don't die easy and decided on a hostile takeover. So, Minion became the new, improved Death's Head, Mark II. I even saved the world when a demonic version of Baron Strucker called Charnel was unleashed... Soon it was just Tuck and me, working jobs across time and space. It was a sweet deal until you had to ruin it... ,	Characters,MI13 (Earth-616)/Members,Dark Guard (Earth-616)/Members,Merry Men (Earth-12892)/Members,Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-8410)/Members,Death³ (Earth-8410)/Members,Male Characters,Robots,Cyborgs,Public Identity Characters,Dan Abnett/Creator,Liam Sharp/Creator,Single Characters,Height 7-8 ft.
