And I want to live. ,—Storm[src],Ororo Munroe is a powerful mutant with weather-manipulating abilities, being also known as the windriding influential super-hero Storm.[25] As the daughter of a Kenyan tribal princess and of an American photojournalist who lived in Cairo, Egypt, she became an orphan after a plane crashed on and destroyed her home. The young Ororo became a sneak-thief on the streets of Cairo under the tutelage of Achmed El Gibár, who provided her a home. As a teenager, she felt an urge to travel to the south, arriving to the Serengeti plains.[26] Venerated by the locals as a goddess, Ororo used her abilities to ease the droughts in the arid desert. She was eventually approached by Professor Xavier to join his X-Men, a mutant group aimed at implementing peace between humans and mutants. Adopting the name Storm, Ororo accepted the offer, intending to comprehend the origin and the potential of her powers.[25],With the X-Men, Storm has had the opportunity to explore the universe in unexpected ways, also rising to prominence in the group and becoming the leader of the team for years.[27] However, her tough experiences have led her to connect to violent aspects of her soul she had never believed to possess.[28] After losing her powers,[29] Storm embarked on a self-discovery journey to reconnect to the source of her abilities.[30][31] Later, Storm formed her own division of X-Men apart from Xavier,[32] that was officially sanctioned by the U.N. as a mutant police force.[33] Storm also has strong ties with the nation of Wakanda, being its former queen due to her marriage to Black Panther.[34],	Characters,Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)/Members,Gods of Wakanda (Earth-616)/Members,Galactic Council (Earth-616)/Members,Great Ring of Arakko (Earth-616)/Members,Marauders (Pryde) (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (Earth-616)/Members,Swordbearers of Krakoa (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)/Members,Crew (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (Jean Grey's) (Earth-616)/Members,Horsemen of Salvation (Earth-616)/Members,Hounds (Earth-811)/Members,X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)/Members,Mutantes Sans Frontières (Earth-616)/Members,Murder Circus (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)/Members,Avengers (Earth-616)/Members,Fantastic Four (Earth-616)/Members,X-Treme Sanctions Executive (Earth-616)/Members,X-Treme X-Men (Earth-616)/Members,Tokyo Arena (Earth-616)/Members,Twelve (Mutants) (Earth-616)/Members,Brides of Set (Earth-616)/Members,Hellfire Club (Earth-616)/Members,Morlocks (Earth-616)/Members,Secret Avengers (Civil War) (Earth-616)/Members,Lady Liberators (Earth-616)/Members,Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616)/Members,Female Characters,Mutants (Homo superior),Deities,Public Identity Characters,Len Wein/Creator,Dave Cockrum/Creator,Single Characters,Height 5 ft. 11 in.
