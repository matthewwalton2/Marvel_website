Portacio started out as an inker at Marvel Comics in 1985. Over time, he was given assignments as a penciller as well. Portacio became noted for his work on such titles as The Punisher, X-Factor, and the Uncanny X-Men. However, in 1992, Portacio left Marvel to co-found Image Comics with six other high-profile artists. But, Portacio quickly withdrew from his partnership in this enterprise due to his sister's bout with lupus, eventually publishing his title Wetworks through Jim Lee's Wildstorm imprint. Other notable series that Portacio has worked on include Stone and Marvel's controversial Heroes Reborn storyline with Iron Man. ,As of 2006, Portacio is returning to his artistic duties at Wildstorm on Wetworks vol.2, which is being written by Mike Carey.,Work History,133 subject(s) created by "Whilce Portacio" ,86 work(s) where "Whilce Portacio" created a cover,13 work(s) that "Whilce Portacio" wrote,73 work(s) that "Whilce Portacio" penciled,36 work(s) that "Whilce Portacio" inked,Images Drawn by Whilce Portacio,112 covers drawn by "Whilce Portacio" ,165 images penciled by "Whilce Portacio" ,78 images inked by "Whilce Portacio" ,Notes,The Bolt-action High-turb Williams-Portacio H57's seen in What The--?! #17 is likely a reference to Whilce Portacio.,See Also,Links and References,Art of Whilce Portacio,Footnotes,Like this?
