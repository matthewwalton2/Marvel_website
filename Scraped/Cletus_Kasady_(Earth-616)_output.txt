We were both sick... because we were incomplete... but not anymore. We healed each other... made each other whole. Neither one of us can survive without the other. Forget host. Forget symbiote. There is only Carnage. ,—Carnage[src],Cletus Kasady is a sociopathic serial killer who has bonded with an alien symbiote to become the notorious super-villain Carnage.,Following a deeply troubled childhood that culminated in him razing an orphanage,[20][21][22][23] Cletus became a serial killer and was eventually convicted for eleven consecutive life sentences. Imprisoned in Ryker's Island, Cletus became cellmates with Eddie Brock, who had been separated from the Venom symbiote. When the symbiote rescued Eddie, it left behind an offspring that bonded to Cletus and merged with his blood, turning him into the monstrous Carnage.[3][24],Over the years, Carnage has been a recurring enemy to Venom, and Spider-Man, Deadpool, and even the Avengers - once leading a group of other murderers and monsters on a rampage across Manhattan. Seemingly killed by the Sentry, Carnage returned more powerful than ever and began harboring megalomaniacal ambitions of conquest and godhood.,	Characters,Cult of Knull (Earth-616)/Members,Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616)/Members,Astonishing Avengers (Earth-616)/Members,Hive (Poisons) (Earth-17952)/Members,Male Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),Public Identity Characters,David Michelinie/Creator,Erik J.
