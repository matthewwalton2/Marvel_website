She wasn't real. That Yuri was a story I made up, a lie I told myself--The good grandaughter I thought I wanted to be. Do you know what a wraith is, Spider-Man? It's a wisp, a trace, a ghost--The fading memory of someone who's gone. There's a reason I took the mask back so easily after giving it up. I didn't understand that fully until I killed a man last night. Yuri Watanabe would have been horrified by what I did. But you know how I felt? I felt free! ,	Characters,New York City Police Department (Earth-616)/Members,United States Army (Earth-616)/Members,Female Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),Secret Identity Characters,Dan Slott/Creator,John Romita Jr./Creator,Single Characters,Black Eyes,Black Hair,Living Characters,Earth-616/Characters,Americans,Vigilantes,Police Officers,Military Personnel,2009 Character Debuts,Yuriko Watanabe (Earth-616)/Quotes,Weapons Expert,Watanabe Family,
