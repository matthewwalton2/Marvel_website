In one sense, it is not a person at all--it is the Uni-Power (an aspect of the Enigma Force) and a manifestation of the Universe itself, a sentient symbiotic energy field that seeks out people in great peril and bonds with them. In another sense, it is every person--it is the potential for heroism that lives in each of us. When the Uni-Power chooses a partner, it endows that person (or, rarely, persons) with the powers, memories, and costume of Captain Universe. The partner can use the powers of Captain Universe until the peril is surmounted. However, if the partner tries to use those powers for personal gain or for evil, the Uni-Power immediately deserts him or her or them.[citation needed],	Characters,Avengers (Earth-616)/Members,Agender Characters,Cosmic Beings,Secret Identity Characters,Bill Mantlo/Creator,Michael Golden/Creator,Single Characters,Variable Height,Variable Weight,Variable Eyes,Variable Hair,Living Characters,Earth-616/Characters,Adventurers,1979 Character Debuts,Captain Universe,Energy Manipulation,Telescopic Vision,Superhuman Senses,Microscopic Vision,Incalculable Strength,Virtually indestructible Durability,Power Amplification,Transmutation,Power Bestowal,Omnilingual,Spider-Geddon participants,Avatar Form,Light Deities,Worthy of Mjolnir,Symbiotes,
