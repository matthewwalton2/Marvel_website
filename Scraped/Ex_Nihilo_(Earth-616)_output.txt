Most people don't really understand it. They perceive it in terms of their own existence--Their own birth, the birth of their children... They measure life by the time they have in theirs. This is life as an extension of love, there's nothing wrong with it... But it is not life unfettered. It's not life as a primal force. It's not the violent struggle of life--It's a bubble making it's way to the surface of a sea. I see life as a perfect sphere, called a planet, resting the perfect distance from a perfect sun. The vast majority of the universe is nothingness. I know this... It is the absence of life. This is how I see it. Understand? Life is a miracle in the face of the lifeless void. What you face now is the end of all miracles. A return to an equilibrium called nothing. But I am Ex Nihilo--I am life. And I will not stand for such a thing. I have to go. ,	Characters,Avengers (Earth-616)/Members,New Avengers (A.I.M.)
