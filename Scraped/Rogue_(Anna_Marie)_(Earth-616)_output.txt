Deciding to secretly attack Ms. Marvel, Rogue unexpectedly absorbed her entire persona, permanently keeping not only her flight and super-strength powers but also her psyche.[13][8] Gravely affected by this experience, Rogue had no choice but to seek help with Mystique's enemy, Professor Charles Xavier, founder and leader of the X-Men. Contrary to other members' disapproval, Xavier took Rogue in as part of the team.[14],Rogue soon proved her worth by becoming one of Xavier's most loyal soldiers by not being afraid of putting herself in danger to protect others.[15] With the X-Men she found relative peace and even managed to get rid of Ms. Marvel's identity.[16] After a long period with the X-Men, she had different opportunities to lead the team[17][18] and also to live a normal powerless life.[19] A notable superhero, Rogue was also a member of the Avengers Unity Division, a team designed to improve mutant-human relations,[20] eventually becoming the leader of the team.[21],	Characters,X-Men (Earth-616)/Members,Excalibur (Earth-616)/Members,Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)/Members,Salvagers (Earth-616)/Members,Lights (Earth-616)/Members,Advocates Squad (Earth-616)/Members,X-Treme X-Men (Earth-616)/Members,X-Treme Sanctions Executive (Earth-616)/Members,Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)/Members,Female Characters,Mutants (Homo superior),Secret Identity Characters,Chris Claremont/Creator,Michael Golden/Creator,Married Characters,Height 5 ft. 8 in.
