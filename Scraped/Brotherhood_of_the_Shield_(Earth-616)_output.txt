	Creators,Dustin Weaver, Jonathan Hickman,First,S.H.I.E.L.D. #1(April, 2010), Once, long ago, I led this group. The great men of this place believed in the future -- in the infinite human experience. Now, I have been warned that the council -- these new men of the shield -- believe in something different: a logical conclusion...inevitability...an end. I have come to shatter this notion. And on that rubble, reconstruct a better way. I am a builder of great things, Leonid... and these men have stood on my shoulders for far too long. ,	Organizations,Secret Identity Organizations,Dustin Weaver/Creator,Jonathan Hickman/Creator,Active Organizations,Earth-616/Organizations,2010 Organization Debuts,Leonardo da Vinci (Earth-616)/Quotes,Egyptian Organizations,Italian Organizations,
