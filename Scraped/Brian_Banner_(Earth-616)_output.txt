DADDY'S HOME. ,—Brian Banner[src],Dr. Brian David Banner was the abusive husband of Rebecca and father of Bruce Banner, who would later be known as the Hulk. While researching about gamma radiation he had a glimpse of the hideous entity known as the One Below All, putting a stop to his research.[3],When Bruce was born, Brian quickly became neglectful towards the infant, to the point of killing his mother in front of him when they were trying to escape. Despite being acquitted, he was arrested and sent to a mental institution after boasting about it while drunk. Fifteen years later, Bruce was resentful but welcomed him into his life again. During a confrontation, Bruce accidentally killed him and blocked these memories.[4][5] During the Chaos War, Brian was resurrected as a fusion of the Devil Hulk and the Guilt Hulk, facing off his son and feeding of his fears, but was overwhelmed when Jarella told Bruce to face them.[6],	Characters,Male Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),No Dual Identity Characters,Bill Mantlo/Creator,Sal Buscema/Creator,Widowed Characters,Height 5 ft. 10 in.
