A shared fiction, if you will. An artist presents a piece to the world in its finished form, and pretends that it simply appeared that way, effortlessly birthed from his genius. Both artist and audience prefer to believe that's the truth. It's nice to think that the really good creators have some direct connection to the divine. But it's a lie. In reality, it's hours and hours of missteps, frustration, and bad ideas that get sliced away to reveal some kind of truth. It's never easy. In fact... It's agony. ,	Characters,Single Characters,Male Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),Secret Identity Characters,Charles Soule/Creator,Ron Garney/Creator,Red Eyes,Bald,White Skin,Deceased Characters,Earth-616/Characters,Americans,Criminals,2016 Character Debuts,Muse (Earth-616)/Quotes,Imperceptibility,Suicide,Painters,
