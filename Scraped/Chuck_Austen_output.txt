Those projects include a brief stint drawing the legendary Miracleman comic book, storyboarding for Mike Judge's King of the Hill animated TV series on Fox, creating the SciFi channel CGI series Tripping the Rift, running the art department at Slave Labor Graphics, and producing his own adult comics Strips and WorldWatch.,Beckum started at Marvel as an artist on Elektra and writer/artist on U.S. War Machine. Such early successes led to higher-profile assignments on Captain America and Exiles, which led in turn to work on Marvel's flagship X-Men franchise.,During this period, due to family friction, Beckum changed his last name to Austen. Another source of friction arose from readers, who loudly protested Austen's disregard for continuity and use of mature themes. Others praised his skill at characterization and willingness to take risks. The controversy apparently became too much for management, who fired Austen in 2004.,Work History,203 subject(s) created by "Chuck Austen" ,14 work(s) where "Chuck Austen" created a cover,125 work(s) that "Chuck Austen" wrote,23 work(s) that "Chuck Austen" penciled,22 work(s) that "Chuck Austen" inked,1 work(s) that "Chuck Austen" colored,Images Drawn by Chuck Austen,16 covers drawn by "Chuck Austen" ,24 images penciled by "Chuck Austen" ,23 images inked by "Chuck Austen" ,4 images colored by "Chuck Austen" ,See Also,Links and References,August 2003 interview with ComiCon,May 2004 interview with Silver Bullet Comics,July 2004 interview with Comixfan,Comic Book Awards Almanac,Footnotes,Like this?
