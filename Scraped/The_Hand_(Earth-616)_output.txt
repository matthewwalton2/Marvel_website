	Creators,Frank Miller,First,Daredevil #174(September, 1981),The Hand is a ninja clan and the current iteration of a pseudo-religious cabal worshiping the demon known as the Beast. The clan is made up of several different factions which are each led by a faction leader and overseen by a single supreme leader or jonin. Rank and file individual members of the clan are known as genin.[2] Originally formed as a secret society by Kagenobu Yoshioka in 1588 and dedicated to Japanese nationalism, the group was infiltrated and corrupted by outside forces: The Sickly Ones (primordial entities responsible for the knowledge and worship of the Beast on earth), the Five (the Sickly Ones' acolytes), and the the Snakeroot ninja clan (an older iteration of the Beast's cabal). The Chaste, a group of mystical warriors, fought the spread of the Beast and its evil.,In the early 20th century, they attempted to secure a foothold in Madripoor at least on two occasions. During World War II, they set out to expand and form connections to other groups, and started working with Romulus and Nazi Baron Strucker, but were opposed by the likes of Wolverine and other adventurers and heroes. They were then involved in the foundation of the modern iteration of Hydra, but were soon purged of it by Baron Strucker, setting uneasy relations between the two groups, though some elements of both organizations collaborated on occasion or on the longer term, even such as high-level as Strucker's wife Baroness Elsbeth von Strucker (who served the agenda of the Sickly Ones) or Hand's Grandmaster Shoji Soma (who enlisted Hand ninja in a strike he conducted with Strucker against Soviet spy organization Leviathan, and recited Hydra's motto).,	Organizations,Secret Identity Organizations,Frank Miller/Creator,Active Organizations,Earth-616/Organizations,1981 Organization Debuts,Criminal Organizations,Terrorist Organizations,Japanese Organizations,Mystical Organizations,
