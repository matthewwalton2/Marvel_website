	Creators,Cullen Bunn, Iban Coello,First,Last,Venomverse #1(September, 2017),Venomized #5(May, 2018), We thought Strange has been summoning us to stop the Poisons from eradicating Venoms... but the truth is worse then we thought - worse then even Strange knew, I bet. You think this is the war? It's not. It's just part of something much, much bigger. The Poisons figured out they were the perfect hosts for Symbiotes. But they don't want a symbiotic relationship. Like any other predator, they want to be the top of the food chain. They're not like us. For them, taking a symbiote is no different than putting on a badass suit of armor. But once Strange started summoning more, one after the other, all with unique abilities the Poisons had never seen before, there was no going back. They stopped caring about Cap's little resistance long ago. You're all tasty treats, but Strange was the real prize. Sure they're coming for the rest of you -- hard -- but that won't be nearly enough. They're so close to eradicating you and turning Strange that they're starting to frenzy like sharks in chummed waters. Eventually, Strange will break, and they'll use him to summon as many souped-up symbiotes as possible. Sooner or later, they'll have all the symbiotes they could ever need. When that happens, do you think they're just gonna relax? NoOoOoO. They'll start branching out, and then they'll use the symbiotes as weapons against anyone who gets in their way. And you'll all be too dead to stop them. ,	Teams,Public Identity Teams,Defunct Teams,Cullen Bunn/Creator,Iban Coello/Creator,Earth-17952/Teams,2017 Team Debuts,Wade Wilson (Earth-41715)/Quotes,
