And if I can't save you, then I have to save the world from what you've become. I bought one of the largest media companies on Earth from under you. I'll use it to sink your drug, Extremis, and I will show the world the monster you've become. They will all know your imperfections, Tony. You won't be their messiah anymore. Your zealots, so blind to the truth. I will open their eyes. Whatever you do from now on, you will do it without admiration, without those who once respected you. You will do it without your friends. You might still manage to force your arrogant vision onto the world. But you will do so broken, unloved... And completely alone. ,	Characters,Stark Resilient (Earth-616)/Members,Lookups (Earth-616)/Members,Underground (Secret Empire) (Earth-616)/Members,Stark Industries (Earth-616)/Members,Order (Initiative) (Earth-616)/Members,50-State Initiative (Earth-616)/Members,Female Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),Cyborgs,Public Identity Characters,Stan Lee/Creator,Robert Bernstein/Creator,Don Heck/Creator,Divorced Characters,Height 5 ft. 4 in.
