I always strive to be superior. ,—Dr. Octavius as Elliot Tolliver[src],Dr. Otto Octavius is a highly intelligent and prideful scientist, better known as the criminal mastermind Doctor Octopus. During an atomic research project, Octavius' body was fused to four mechanical, tentacle-like arms, also causing him severe damage that turned him into a criminal. He clashed with Spider-Man and went to become one of his greatest enemies.[21] After multiple battles, Otto's body started to fail and decay itself.[22] In one last attempt to survive, Otto swapped brains with his nemesis, leaving Spider-Man to die in his fragile body.[23] However, residual memories caused Otto to understand the responsibility of being a hero and strived to become the Superior Spider-Man, a better crime-fighter than his nemesis ever was.[17][24] Despite his best efforts, Otto's ruthless method of justice was futile in stopping the return of Green Goblin, forcing Otto to cede control of his body, sacrificing himself in the process, back to Peter, understanding him to be the one worthy of being called Spider-Man.[25],	Characters,Thunderbolts (Earth-616)/Members,Sinister Six (Earth-616)/Members,Masters of Evil (Earth-616)/Members,Legion Accursed (Earth-616)/Members,Superior Spider-Army (Earth-928)/Members,Parker Industries (Earth-616)/Members,New U Technologies (Earth-616)/Members,Hydra (Earth-616)/Members,Avengers (Hydra) (Earth-616)/Members,Horizon University (Earth-616)/Members,Night Shift (Earth-616)/Members,Hospital for Emergency Aid and Recuperative Therapy (Earth-616)/Members,Spider-Army (Multiverse)/Members,Spiderlings (Earth-616)/Members,Avengers (Earth-616)/Members,Superior Six (Earth-616)/Members,Mighty Avengers (Cage) (Earth-616)/Members,Horizon Labs (Earth-616)/Members,Atomic Research Center (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Mutates,Humans (Homo sapiens),Public Identity Characters,Stan Lee/Creator,Steve Ditko/Creator,Single Characters,Height 5 ft. 9 in.
