Under the influence of the dark god Knull, Tyrannosaurus rampaged across Vietnam but was inspired by Logan and Rex's nobility to break free of Knull's control. When Rex was killed by a Nick Fury Life-Model Decoy, Tyrannosaurus assumed his identity and became an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., coincidentally assigned with hunting itself down.[1][3] Years later, Tyrannosaurus tracked down Eddie Brock - the current host of the Venom symbiote - and recruited him to rescue the other Sym-Soldiers. Unfortunately, its plans backfired and the Grendel resurfaced again, forcing Tyrannosaurus to bond to Eddie and ultimately sacrifice itself in an attempt to stop Knull from being unleashed; with only a sample of the Grendel surviving.[5],	Characters,Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)/Members,Sym-Soldier Program (Earth-616)/Members,Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616)/Members,Agender Characters,Symbiotes,Secret Identity Characters,Donny Cates/Creator,Ryan Stegman/Creator,Variable Height,Variable Weight,Variable Eyes,No Hair,Black Skin,Fangs,Claws,Deceased Characters,Earth-616/Characters,2018 Character Debuts,Tyrannosaurus (Symbiote) (Earth-616)/Quotes,Shapeshifters,Tentacles,Vietnam War Characters,Gestalt Characters,
