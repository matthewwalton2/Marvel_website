He'll just have to take a meeting--with War Machine! ,—War Machine[src],A skilled military pilot, Jim Rhodes is one of the few people Tony Stark trusts to use the technology of the Iron Man Armor, flying high in his own suit as War Machine. An aviator engineer for Stark Industries,[15] Rhodes was also the personal pilot and eventually confidant of Tony Stark. When Tony was overwhelmed by his relapsing alcoholism, Rhodey donned the Iron Man suit himself.[16] Although he stepped up to the mark, the lack of proper calibrations in the armor affected Rhodey's psyche and he had to step down,[17] paving the way for Tony to return as Iron Man.[18] Later on, after Stark was seemingly assassinated, Rhodey reluctantly heeded Tony's will and became Iron Man again, wearing a new armor made specifically for him.[19] Once he learned that Stark had survived in secret,[20] Rhodey temporarily cut ties with him,[21] and went solo, adopting the alias of War Machine.[22],	Characters,United States Armed Forces (Earth-616)/Members,Space Friends (Earth-616)/Members,Force Works (Earth-616)/Members,Deathloks (Earth-616)/Members,Stark Unlimited (Earth-616)/Members,Stark Resilient (Earth-616)/Members,Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)/Members,Avengers (Earth-616)/Members,Secret Avengers (S.H.I.E.L.D.)
