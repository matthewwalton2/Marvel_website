Which leads to something of a quandary, doesn't it? How can you trust an animal to keep it's word? You can't. Which leads us to the more interesting question, which is: Why would you succumb to the tyrant's request at all?  You know by now that we kill your world if ours is to live. Your death is inevitable... So how could we threaten you with the promise of what is already  assured? That assurance--That truth--Is undeniable. A strong man would hide behind the walls of that truth--He would make a fortress out of it against which no siege would succeed. He would find... Some victory in that death. Why then, faced with the facts at hand, am I so sure that you will beg? And the walls came crumbling down. ,	Characters,X-Men (Earth-71202)/Members,Male Characters,Mutants (Homo superior),Secret Identity Characters,Jonathan Hickman/Creator,Valerio Schiti/Creator,Single Characters,Blue Eyes,Bald,Living Characters,Earth-71202/Characters,Americans,Adventurers,Teachers,2014 Character Debuts,Tyros (Earth-13054)/Quotes,Xavier Family,Telepaths,Time Runs Out casualties,
