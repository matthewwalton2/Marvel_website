In the post-WWII years, he entered the comic book field working for several publishers, including stories for Crestwood's American Eagle.

We had our Bullpen up there until about 1958 or 1959. [sic; the Bullpen staff was let go in 1957] The guys... who actually worked nine-to-five and put in a regular day, and not the freelance guys who'd come in a drop off their work ... were almost a hall-of-fame group of people. There was John Severin. Bill Everett. Carl Burgos. There was the all-time great Joe Maneely... We all worked together, all the colorists and correction guys, the letterers and artists... We had a great time. ,--Stan Goldberg, Atlas/Marvel artist and colorist ,Work History,52 subject(s) created by "John Severin" ,200 work(s) where "John Severin" created a cover,100 work(s) that "John Severin" penciled,164 work(s) that "John Severin" inked,1 work(s) that "John Severin" colored,Images Drawn by John Severin,136 covers drawn by "John Severin" ,62 images penciled by "John Severin" ,153 images inked by "John Severin" ,See Also,Links and References,Wikipedia:John Severin,John Severin interview, The Comics Journal,Footnotes,Like this?
