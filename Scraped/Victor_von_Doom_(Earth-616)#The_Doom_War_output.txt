"Master of the Sun." You claim such vast domains. Is it to balance your small souls? Could I not lay claim to the light and the void, if I wished it? Have I not earned such titles? I, who have mastered all arts, all sciences, all secrets? Whose technology and magic cross the stars as easily as they scramble an alpha telepath's mind? Who would dare to say I have not earned the right? Yet I am king of a simple nation. On a simple planet. A beloved garden tended by iron hands. And the only title I have ever claimed... is doctor. ,—Doctor Doom[src],	Characters,Parliament of Doom (Multiverse)/Members,Galactic Council (Earth-616)/Members,Zefiro Clan (Earth-616)/Members,Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)/Members,Terrific Three (Earth-TRN799)/Members,Avengers (Doctor Doom's) (Earth-616)/Members,Astonishing Avengers (Earth-616)/Members,Future Foundation (Earth-616)/Members,Intelligencia (Earth-616)/Members,Cabal (Dark Illuminati) (Earth-616)/Members,Knights of the Atomic Round Table (Earth-616)/Members,Hydra (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)/Members,Legion Accursed (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),Public Identity Characters,Stan Lee/Creator,Jack Kirby/Creator,Married Characters,Height 6 ft. 2 in.
