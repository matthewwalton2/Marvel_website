Given he couldn't draw at all, he used the Final Fantasy sprites  he had downloaded and created 8-Bit Theater, which eventually became his primary work for many years.[citation needed] In 2006, he made a jump to print comics with Atomic Robo. Eventually in 2009, Clevinger got an opportunity with Marvel Comics, retelling the Infinity Gauntlet storyline for the kids-focused series Marvel Adventures in Avengers & the Infinity Gauntlet Vol 1. He was later put on a small project writing a promotional Iron Man comic for a Taco Bell tie-in, which Clevinger cited as a fond memory of working for Marvel.
