	Creators,Charles Soule, John Timms,First,Inhumans: Attilan Rising #1(May, 2015), Lord Doom holds the world together. But perhaps we do our part, in some small way. The domains make for a complex mix--So many cultures, so many enmities, old and new. The Quiet Room provides a less formal setting than the negotiation tables at Doomstadt. We guarantee absolute safety and complete discretion. Everything here is sourced from across the domains. Tonight's special is pre-roasted quail from the Valley of Flame, seasoned with genetically engineered spices from Dystopia. Seemed appropriate, with Peter Quill on stage. It's Quill and quail night. Some say patience is the heart of diplomacy. And maybe so. But I think one hell of a glass of champagne doesn't hurt. ,	Locations,Earth-15513/Locations,Charles Soule/Creator,John Timms/Creator,Battleworld (Latverion),Kingdom of Manhattan,Locales,2015 Location Debuts,Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-61610)/Quotes,Bars,Milky Way,Sol,Earth,United States of America,New York (State),New York City,Manhattan,Grand Central Station,
