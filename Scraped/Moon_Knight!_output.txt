Once a mercenary, Marc Spector was left for dead in the desert, where he was revived by the Moon god Khonshu. Appointed as Khonshu's fist and high priest, Moon Knight enacts justice to protect those who travel at night. Spector also suffers from dissociative identity disorder, which has paved the way for his use of other identities, including millionaire Steven Grant and cab driver Jake Lockley.[14][23],In the beginning of his career, Marc fought crime on the streets with the help of a network of informants, including his best friend "Frenchie" Duchamp, the homeless Bertrand Crawley and diner owner Gena Landers.[24][14] Since the early days, Marc has mostly worked alone, but he's also been a member of a few superhero teams, including the Avengers (both the Black Ops Unit[25] and the West Coast branch)[26] and the Heroes For Hire.[27],	Characters,Midnight Mission (Earth-616)/Members,Midnight Sons (Earth-616)/Members,Secret Avengers (Black Ops Unit) (Earth-616)/Members,United States Marine Corps (Earth-616)/Members,Central Intelligence Agency (Earth-616)/Members,Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)/Members,Marvel Knights (Earth-616)/Members,Defenders (Earth-616)/Members,Heroes for Hire (Knight & Wing) (Earth-616)/Members,Committee (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Hellbent,Deities,Public Identity Characters,Doug Moench/Creator,Don Perlin/Creator,Married Characters,Height 6 ft. 2 in.
