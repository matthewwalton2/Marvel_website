But men like Barnes stole that birthright from too many of our brothers, until the injustice tore this nation apart. And so a Red man taught a Black man to find a White man who would bring us all back together. Why it had to work that way, and why his search led to me, I'll never know. Maybe We-Pi-Ahk saw me save those children in the barn. Maybe all it took was that small act of decency in the midst of the killing. Whatever the reason, the Eagle chose me to ensure that for all of us, America remains the land of opportunity. ,	Characters,United States Army (Earth-717)/Members,Redlegs Regiment (Earth-717)/Members,Male Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),Public Identity Characters,Tony Bedard/Creator,Carmine Di Giandomenico/Creator,Single Characters,Blue Eyes,Blond Hair,Living Characters,Earth-717/Characters,Americans,Adventurers,Military Personnel,2005 Character Debuts,Stephen Rogers (Earth-717)/Quotes,Magic-Based Mutates,Rogers Family,Shield Fighting,American Civil War (Event) Characters,
