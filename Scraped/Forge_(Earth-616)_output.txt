Deep inside. That is where I live. That is where I get to be a super hero... They don't understand what they don't see... But I see. I see it all. I see things before they are real. It always starts with a problem. An impractical, unattainable, unworkable problem that needs to be solved. Then... I solve it. I work it. I attain it. I move and shift and reshape. Make something out of nothing. I prepare my unfeasible solutions for birth. And when they've incubated and grown and developed, I bring them into the world. I am a midwife of the impossible. I am Forge. I make the impossible real. ,	Characters,X-Men (Earth-616)/Members,X-Force (Earth-616)/Members,X-Factor (Government) (Earth-616)/Members,Muir Island X-Men (Earth-616)/Members,Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Earth-616)/Members,New Mutants (Forge) (Earth-616)/Members,Stark Industries (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Mutants (Homo superior),Cyborgs,Public Identity Characters,Chris Claremont/Creator,John Romita Jr./Creator,Single Characters,Height 6 ft. 0 in.
