Through him, I saw the history of our race more clearly than ever. How we'd been betrayed. First the Skrulls offered the temptation of animal "technology," a way of life we never needed... and then the barbaric Kree slaughtered us for those twinkling baubles. Such injustices had to be avenged--as is our way. And we could not stop there. My father's template was a human. He knew the depths such animals could sink to. For the good of all true life, they had to be purged... their grotesque sins against us redeemed... in death. ,	Characters,Empyre (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Cotati,Hybrids,Humans (Homo sapiens),Secret Identity Characters,Steve Englehart/Creator,Rich Buckler/Creator,Single Characters,Height 5 ft. 8 in.
