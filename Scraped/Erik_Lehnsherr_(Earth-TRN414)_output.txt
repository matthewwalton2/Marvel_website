Why? Because you are afraid of our gifts. Because we are different. Humanity has always feared that which is different. Well, I'm here to tell you, to tell the world, you're right to fear us! We are the future! We are the ones who will inherit this earth! And anyone who stands in our way will suffer the same fate as these men you see before you! Today was meant to be a display of your power. Instead, I give you a glimpse of the devastation my race can unleash upon yours! Let this be a warning to the world. And to my mutant brothers and sisters out there, I say this: no more hiding. No more suffering. You have lived in the shadows in shame and fear for too long. Come out. Join me. Fight together in a brotherhood of our kind! A new tomorrow, that starts today! ,	Characters,Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-TRN414)/Members,Brotherhood of Mutants (Earth-TRN414)/Members,X-Men (Earth-TRN414)/Members,Central Intelligence Agency (Earth-TRN414)/Members,Division X (Earth-TRN414)/Members,Male Characters,Mutants (Homo superior),Public Identity Characters,Simon Kinberg/Creator,Widowed Characters,Height 6 ft. 0 in.
