Big grizzly. That was 1922, in the Yukon, and he kept us through a cold winter. In Spain, I fought bulls and fascists -- and I let the bulls live. In Nepal, I hunted the Tiger God and killed all fear in me. I've fought queens of dreams and the world's secret master. I've fought demons in hell and stolen their thrones -- and those thrones haven't bound me. And it all comes back to one thing. I was eight, full of bear meat and adventure -- and I made a vow, Mr. Creel. I vowed I would live an interesting life. I think I've done okay so far, eh? ,	Characters,Gamma Flight (Alpha Flight Space Program) (Earth-616)/Members,Alpha Flight (Earth-616)/Members,Alpha Flight (Space Program) (Earth-616)/Members,X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)/Members,Beta Flight (Earth-616)/Members,Outcasts (Mercenaries) (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Genetically Engineered,Mutates,Humans (Homo sapiens),Public Identity Characters,John Byrne/Creator,Single Characters,Height 3-4 ft.
