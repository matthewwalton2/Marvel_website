Apocalypse genetically mutated Essex, transforming him into his first prelate, known as Mister Sinister.[46] Through the years, Mister Sinister became one of the greatest geneticists to have ever lived, skilled cloning, creating new life, and even in the manipulation of mutant DNA for enhancing powers, incorporating mutant DNA to his own.[47],Mister Sinister spent most of his life scheming ways to break free from his designer, Apocalypse.[48] For that purpose, he secretly manipulated the lives of major representatives of the mutant race, such as Cyclops,[49] Jean Grey,[50] Gambit,[51] Havok,[52] and even Professor X.[45] The main results of his machinations were the creation of Madelyne Pryor[50] and the birth of Nathan Summers, whom he believed to be the bringer of Apocalypse's end.[53] Mister Sinister's actions directly crossed the lives of the X-Men after he ordered his Marauders to massacre the Morlocks.[54],	Characters,Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)/Members,Hellions (Essex) (Earth-616)/Members,Marauders (Earth-616)/Members,New Intelligencia (Earth-616)/Members,Sinister's Six (Earth-616)/Members,Weapon X Project (Earth-616)/Members,Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)/Members,Nasty Boys (Earth-616)/Members,Black Womb Project (Earth-616)/Members,National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)/Members,Royal Society (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Artificial Mutants,Mutates,Chimeras (Mutants),Genetically Engineered,Humans (Homo sapiens),Secret Identity Characters,Chris Claremont/Creator,Marc Silvestri/Creator,Widowed Characters,Height 6 ft. 5 in.
