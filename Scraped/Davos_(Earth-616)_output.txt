He didn't understand why  no one else recognized his potential. Not the Yu-Ti. Not the Thunderer, his own father. At every turn he's been held back. Is it a wonder he has a problem with authority? He takes what little they have to offer. These insect. These ants. He rips their life force from their bodies and heals his wounds. Flesh bubbles closed. Blood coagulates. Bones fuse. He takes it all so that he may stand while they fall. If he had enough of it, the Chi of Shou-Lao... could he heal his heart, too? And if he was simply given the love he needed in the first place... but K'un-Lun was never a place for love. All it offered was fire and blood. Can you blame him for accepting? ,	Characters,Immortal Weapons (Earth-616)/Members,Rand Corporation (Earth-616)/Members,Hydra (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),Public Identity Characters,Chris Claremont/Creator,John Byrne/Creator,Single Characters,Height 6 ft. 1 in.
