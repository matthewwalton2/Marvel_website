'Cause I did that for you. Kept everyone safe. Kept them from being scared. And I made it fun. It doesn't matter that most of 'em wouldn't have lifted a finger for Peter Parker. That's not why you do it. You do it 'cause it's the right thing to do. Because it's what you would've done. You were more than a father to me, Ben Parker. More than a role model...You were my hero. Now it's my turn. Because from now on, I'm going to be yours! You'll see. I'm going to give it my all! We'll have fun! I'll never quit--and it's going to be amazing! ,—Spider-Man (Peter Parker)[src],Sometimes student, sometimes scientist and sometimes photographer, Peter Parker is a full-time super hero better known as the web-slinging and wall-crawling Spider-Man. An orphaned child, Peter was raised by his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. At a science expo, Peter was bitten by an errant radioactive spider which granted him an array of arachnid powers. He initially became Spider-Man to use his powers as an entertainer, growing so conceited he didn't bother stopping a passerby burglar. In a twist of fate, the same burglar wound up killing Peter's Uncle Ben, leading him to realize that he needed to use his powers responsibly.[103] From then on, Spider-Man became a crime-fighting vigilante.[104],Often a loner, Spider-Man is a stalwart member of the super hero community who has earned numerous allies like the Fantastic Four and the Avengers. He has made of numerous super villains his personal enemies, including Doctor Octopus, Electro, Kraven the Hunter, Mysterio, Venom, and most notoriously, his nemesis the Green Goblin, who once killed Peter's girlfriend Gwen Stacy.[105] Peter's support network extends to his civilian life, including Mary Jane Watson, Harry Osborn, Flash Thompson and J. Jonah Jameson, although the latter used to run a smear campaign against the wall-cralwer on his newspaper, the Daily Bugle.,	Characters,Threats and Menaces (Earth-616)/Members,Daily Bugle (Front Line) (Earth-616)/Members,Uncle Ben Foundation (Earth-616)/Members,Parker Industries (Earth-616)/Members,Horizon Labs (Earth-616)/Members,Parker Technologies (Earth-11638)/Members,Daily Bugle (The DB!)
