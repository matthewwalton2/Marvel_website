And I have an M.D. in psychiatry... So when I say you're crazy... You're crazy. ,—Ms. Marvel[src],Karla Sofen was a renowned psychiatrist, who enjoyed manipulating her patients into paranoia rather than helping them.[9] Her unethical behavior as a psychiatrist led her to be an assistant of the villainous Doctor Faustus,[10] and her manipulative skills only grew under the tutelage of Faustus. This allowed her to pave her way to Lloyd Bloch, the original Moonstone. Drugging Lloyd with hallucinogens, Sofen persuaded him into giving her the Moonstone, the Kree device that granted him immense powers.[11] As the new Moonstone, Karla became a prominent super-criminal, being recruited into Baron Zemo's Masters of Evil and facing the Avengers on several occasions.[12] When the Avengers went missing, the Masters of Evil pretended to be super-heroes, naming themselves the Thunderbolts. Moonstone reinvented herself as the fake super-hero named Meteorite.[3][13],The Thunderbolts' hoax ultimately leaned them into genuine heroic activities.[14] Moonstone then became romantically involved with Hawkeye, who had taken control of the Thunderbolts to encourage them to be heroes.[15] However, Moonstone's villainous side flourished again when the Thunderbolts' leadership fell into Norman Osborn's hands.[16] When Osborn decided to create his own Dark Avengers team, Moonstone was invited to the team as Ms. Marvel.[17] Through the years, Moonstone was a member of several iterations of both the Thunderbolts and the Dark Avengers.[18][19][20][21],	Characters,Thunderbolts (Earth-616)/Members,Army of Evil (Earth-616)/Members,Masters of Evil (Earth-616)/Members,Dark Avengers (Earth-616)/Members,H.A.M.M.E.R.
