I'll tell you, Peter Parker. Sure, you're smart... and talented... and sweet... But most of all? No matter what life puts in your way? No matter what obstacle? You always keep moving forward.

I love that. ,	Characters,Female Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),No Dual Identity Characters,Robbie Thompson/Creator,Nick Bradshaw/Creator,Single Characters,Blue Eyes,Blond Hair,Living Characters,Earth-16220/Characters,Americans,Students,2015 Character Debuts,Gwendolyne Stacy (Earth-16220)/Quotes,Stacy Family,Midtown High School Students,Twitter Users,
