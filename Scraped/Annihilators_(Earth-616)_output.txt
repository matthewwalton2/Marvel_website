	Creators,Dan Abnett, Andy Lanning, Miguel Sepulveda,First,Thanos Imperative: Devastation #1(January, 2011), I almost made it work. The Guardians were more than I could ever have hoped for! But the universe is also more dangerous than I ever imagined! Look around! This is the kind of thing that can happen! The galaxy doesn't need guardians! It doesn't need brave souls! If it's going to survive another one of these, it's going to need absolute bad-asses! It's going to need the biggest guns of all! Cosmic heavy hitters as scary as the menaces they have to face! It's going to need flarking annihilators! ,	Teams,Public Identity Teams,Active Teams,Dan Abnett/Creator,Andy Lanning/Creator,Miguel Ángel Sepúlveda/Creator,Earth-616/Teams,2011 Team Debuts,Peter Quill (Earth-616)/Quotes,Cosmic Teams,
