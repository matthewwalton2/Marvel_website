Jazz, hip-hop, punk rock... Music and fashion can change the world. ,—The Wasp[src],Janet van Dyne is a fashion designer and socialite who is well known as the winsome Wasp. In order to avenge the death of her father at the hands of an extradimensional creature, she was infused with Pym Particles and was biologically altered by Dr. Hank Pym, secretly the adventurer known as Ant-Man. As the Wasp, she became Pym's crime-fighting partner, having the ability to alter her size, fly at rapid speeds with synthetic wings and fire energy stings.[14] Alongside Pym, the Wasp is a founding member of the Avengers, "Earth's Mightiest Heroes", being personally responsible for choosing the name of the group.[31],The Wasp eventually got married to Pym,[8] but their relationship would turn out to be a tragic experience as she became a victim of domestic violence.[32] She has weaponized the pain of her hurtful divorce by becoming one of the most prominent, efficient and empathetic Avengers' leaders.[33][34] During the Skrull invasion, the Wasp had her powers tampered with to serve as a last suicide attack for the aliens. Her apparent death actually led to the end of the war, and Earth was protected through her sacrifice.[35] She was later found lost in Microverse by the original Avengers and returned to her superheroic career.[36],	Characters,Agents of Wakanda (Earth-616)/Members,Pym Laboratories (Earth-616)/Members,NEVELL (Earth-616)/Members,Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)/Members,Avengers (Earth-616)/Members,Lady Liberators (Earth-616)/Members,Defenders (Earth-616)/Members,Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)/Members,Avengers (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)/Members,Time-Displaced Avengers (Multiverse)/Members,Mighty Avengers (Initiative) (Earth-616)/Members,50-State Initiative (Earth-616)/Members,Friends of Miss America (Earth-616)/Members,Axis (Avengers) (Earth-616)/Members,Female Characters,Pym Particles,Mutates,Humans (Homo sapiens),Cyborgs,Public Identity Characters,Stan Lee/Creator,Ernest Hart/Creator,Jack Kirby/Creator,Divorced Characters,Height 5 ft. 4 in.
