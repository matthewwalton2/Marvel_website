We must not fail. I told you all I'd reclaim you from the veil of tears, and so I have. And now you must be ready for your work. Go forth and bring my terror to this place. Spread my gospel across this tomb of a globe we remain trapped upon. Punish and terrify every single living thing you can. You must not tire and you must not fail... Show no mercy here; show no patience for these vermin. See them driven before you. Beat them and maul them and break them any way you know how. Do not stop. Make them tremble. Make them beg. Fill them with doubt and panic. And fear... Crush their capitals. Bring their leaders to their knees. Make them beg for mercy. Always fear. Our time is at hand! Go foward in war and slaughter! ,	Characters,Thunder Guard (Earth-616)/Members,Worthy (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Asgardian Gods,Deities,Virtual Immortals,Hybrids,Frost Giants,Aesir,Secret Identity Characters,Stuart Immonen/Creator,Matt Fraction/Creator,Single Characters,Height 6 ft. 2 in.
