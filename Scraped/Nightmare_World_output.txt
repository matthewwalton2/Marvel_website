	First,Unknown,Nightmare World was a realm within the Dream Dimension, ruled by Nightmare.[1][11] It was set in the Archipelago of Anguish and Redemption.[8][5],It was described as the borderlands of madness and myths, and bordered both Alchera, home of the Aboriginal gods,[10] and the Astral Plane.[12] It is also stated that the Realm of Madness (whose denizens are natural enemies of Nightmare,[1] though some of them served Nightmare as well) bordered it[3] and was beyond it.[13] Nightmare's realm was also bordered by the kingdoms of Anesthesia and Coma. When Stephen G. Diesner wrote about Nightmare, the demon became a fictional character, and he and his minions could access the Land of Fiction, now bordering his realm.[6] The Land of Fiction became for a time part of Nightmare's kingdom.[7],	Locations,Dream Dimension,Dreamtime,Archipelago of Anguish and Redemption,Dimensions,Location Creators Needed,Battleworld (Maelstrom),Isles of Agamotto,
