Willow Wilson, Jorge Molina,First,Destruction,A-Force #1(May, 2015),A-Force #5(October, 2015), In the vast oceans of our planet, isolated from the forbidden domains of Battleworld... there is an island. Our island is red roofs and friendly dogs, green hills and water blue as heartache. It is bells at dawn and bells at dusk, rising towers of stone and silver, clay and chrome. It is its people, the good, the bad, and all the rest of us -- doctors and lawyers, teachers and thieves, scientists and artists, musicians and mystics, brothers and sisters-in-arms -- heroes, and villains. Family and friends. In the shadow of the Shield, with the sun on the sea... there is an island. Welcome to Arcadia. It's pretty tight. ,—She-Hulk[src],	Locations,Earth-15513/Locations,Marguerite Bennett/Creator,G.
