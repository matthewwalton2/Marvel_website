	Creators,Alan Moore, Alan Davis,First,Daredevils #3(March, 1983), Welcome, my old friends. You may be shocked to be waking up here, but let me catch you up. The psychic powers you have displayed since our days in British Intelligence have been a result of your mutant X genes. Mutants like us cat come back from the dead now. And mutants like us can never go home to the UK. The nation we served, some of us with our lives, has cast our kind out. But let's make them regret it, shall we? Let's get to work, S.T.R.I.K.E. ,—Pete Wisdom[src],	Teams,Secret Identity Teams,Alan Moore/Creator,Alan Davis/Creator,Active Teams,Earth-616/Teams,1983 Team Debuts,Peter Wisdom (Earth-616)/Quotes,
