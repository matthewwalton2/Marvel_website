Taking your city apart. Brink by brink. Soon, all the power will be ours. And when it is, your dimension will be destroyed. Everyone and everything you have ever loved will be gone. Not even a memory. It is not a matter of if it will happen. Only when. ,	Teams,Public Identity Teams,Active Teams,Gameloft/Creator,Multiverse/Teams,2014 Team Debuts,Otto Octavius (Earth-TRN461)/Quotes,Interdimensional Organizations,Terrorist Organizations,
