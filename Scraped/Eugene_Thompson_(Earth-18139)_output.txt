Spider-Man (Vol. 2) #1(October, 2018), All my life, I wanted people to look up to me. Sports star, big man on campus, captain of the football team. But what was I, really? What am I, really? A bully. A killer. I'm no hero but maybe, for once in my lousy life... I can stop thinking about who I want to love me... and who I hate. I can finally stop being scared I'm not good enough. Because I'm not. I'm not a hero. But if I try long enough and hard enough and make amends... maybe someday I might get to be a good guy. ,	Characters,Single Characters,Male Characters,Mutates,Humans (Homo sapiens),No Dual Identity Characters,Gerry Conway/Creator,Diego Olortegui/Creator,Blue Eyes,Strawberry Blond Hair,Living Characters,Earth-18139/Characters,Americans,Adventurers,Wrestlers,Vigilantes,Retired Characters,Students,2018 Character Debuts,Eugene Thompson (Earth-18139)/Quotes,Energy Senses,Enhanced Durability,Leaping,Precogs,Superhuman Agility,Superhuman Reflexes,Superhuman Senses,Superhuman Speed,Superhuman Stamina,Superhuman Strength,Wallcrawling,Athletic Skills,Human/Spider Hybrids,Midtown High School Students,Radioactive Spider-Powered,Thompson Family,
