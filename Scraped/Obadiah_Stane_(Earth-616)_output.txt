I concede your superiority at that, Tony. You do not mind me using your first name, do you? But have you won, truly? I think not, for I have always believed that the essential part of winning is to enjoy your opponent's humiliation at losing. That is the real reward of the game. Of that I can deprive you. That is what my father deprived everyone of. He saw the world as his opponent and at the last he realised that he could not win. If he had not done it that night, he would have done it another...
