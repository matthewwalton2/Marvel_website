The Thing has no apparent neck. He has only four fingers (including the thumb) on each hand and four toes on each foot. The increase in the volume of his fingers has not decreased his manual dexterity. His skin is apparently susceptible to "drying" or what in a normal human being would be called loss of skin oil, for his skin can be "chipped" under certain circumstances. The Thing has no outer ear structure. Appears to be covered by what appears to be several crater-like impressions across his body.,	Origin,Human Cosmic Ray mutate,Living Status,Deceased,Reality,Earth-26111,Place of Birth,New York City, New York,	Identity,Public,Citizenship,American,Occupation,Adventurer,	Creators,Brian Michael Bendis, Brandon Peterson,First,Death,Age of Ultron #7(May, 2013),Age of Ultron #8(May, 2013),	Characters,Defenders (Earth-26111)/Members,Fantastic Four (Earth-26111)/Members,Male Characters,Cosmic Ray Exposure,Mutates,Humans (Homo sapiens),Public Identity Characters,Brian Michael Bendis/Creator,Brandon Peterson/Creator,Single Characters,Height 6 ft. 0 in.
