Nightcrawler has pointed ears and pronounced fang-like canine teeth. His spine is more flexible than an ordinary human being's, allowing him to spend much of his time in a semi-crouching position without damaging his posture and enabling him to perform contortionist-like feats.

He performed as a trapeze artist in the carnival where his adoptive family worked, alongside his siblings Jimaine and Stefan.[7] After Stefan became a vile mass-murderer in Winzeldorf, Kurt unintentionally executed his own brother. Their conflict caught the attention of a mob, who believed Kurt to be a murderous demon and decided to hunt and lynch him.[8] Kurt was ultimately saved by Professor Charles Xavier of the X-Men, who invited him to join the super-hero mutant group as Nightcrawler.[9],Nightcrawler soon became one of the most respected and beloved members of the X-Men, due to his charming attitude and kind soul. Eventually, the X-Men have become his family and he led the team in several opportunities.[10][11] Nightcrawler was also a prominent member and even the leader of the British-based mutant group Excalibur for years.[12] As a member of the X-Men, Nightcrawler paid the ultimate price to ensure the survival of the first mutant born after the M-Day, Hope Summers.[13] Years later, he found his way back to the land of the living and to the X-Men.[14],	Characters,Name legally changed,Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (Earth-616)/Members,Studio X (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (Jean Grey's) (Earth-616)/Members,Hounds (Earth-811)/Members,X-Men (Magneto's) (Earth-616)/Members,X-Treme Sanctions Executive (Earth-616)/Members,Excalibur (Earth-616)/Members,Herr Getmann's Traveling Menagerie (Earth-616)/Members,Catholic Church (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Mutants (Homo superior),Secret Identity Characters,Len Wein/Creator,Dave Cockrum/Creator,Single Characters,Height 5 ft. 9 in.
