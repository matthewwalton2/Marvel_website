I hear what you all say about me. About us. And it's fine. Honestly, I've been hearing this question since this all started... hell, I even heard it from my kid. "Is Venom a good guy... or a bad guy?" I get it. I do. I know we can be... you know... a little erratic. We've been on both sides of the line so many times even I can't keep track. It's a fair question is what I'm trying to say. And the answer... I don't know. It's not easy... when this all started... when I first got the symbiote and... gave myself this "cool" name, I... Lord help me, I thought-- I thought I was doing the right thing. I genuinely thought that killing Spider-Man was the right thing to do. I honestly did. And looking back at it now... God... what was wrong with me? I know. I know. That doesn't answer the question, right? But... it kinda does. You ask me if I'm a good guy or a bad guy, and, well... I mean, if I didn't think I was a bad guy when I was trying to kill Spider-Man, how can I trust myself to answer it now? I think the truth is that I... I so want to be. I want people to look at me the way they look at him. At Spider-Man. I've seen it. They see him, and they know everything is going to be okay. They look at me and... I don't know. Maybe I don't think I'm good enough of a guy to be a good guy. But... I'm trying. We're trying. Every day. ,—Eddie Brock[src],Eddie Brock is the former-villain-turned-hero Venom. Starting his career as a failed reporter unwittingly due to the actions of Spider-Man, he would go to Our Lady of Saints Church to ask God forgiveness before attempting suicide. However, a symbiote that was earlier discarded there by Spider-Man sensed his anger and merged with him, becoming one of the deadliest foes of Spider-Man.,Going by the alias of Venom,[4] he would give birth to another symbiote that bonded with the serial killer Cletus Kasady to become Carnage.[17] For a time, Eddie agreed to a truce with Spider-Man and moved to San Francisco, where he became the antiheroic "Lethal Protector" of an Underground City, but returned to villainy following a failed stint as a black ops government assassin. Parting ways with the Venom symbiote, Eddie began to seek redemption for his dark past - bonding to the Anti-Venom and Toxin symbiotes,[3][5] before finally returning as Venom and attempting to become a true hero.[18][19],	Characters,Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616)/Members,Sinister Six (Earth-616)/Members,Food, Emergency Aid, Shelter and Training (Earth-616)/Members,Revengers (Earth-616)/Members,Savage Six (Crime-Master's) (Earth-616)/Members,Anti-Symbiote Task Force (Earth-616)/Members,Federal Bureau of Investigation (Earth-616)/Members,Resistance (Venomverse) (Earth-22249)/Members,Daily Globe (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),Public Identity Characters,David Michelinie/Creator,Todd McFarlane/Creator,Divorced Characters,Height 6 ft. 3 in.
