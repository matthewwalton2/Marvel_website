You have my gratitude. And you deserve answers. I was a deep cover agent, deployed under the fleet of the third spiral arm at the very outset of the war between Kree and Skrull. The Skrulls could not match us culturally nor technologically, but they had one great biological advantage... they could change shape. Blend in, hide in plain sight. We couldn't match that... until we discovered the Symbiotes. Beings who could bond with a Kree, give us strength, speed and at least a cosmetic ability to emulate the Skrull shape-shifting. I was selected from a pool of hundreds of recruits. The symbiote was harvested from its homeworld, both of us put through... grueling training. Months. And our mission was successful. We'd found a way to end the war. But my people had fallen under the sway of a zealot, and were betrayed. I was betrayed. I saved the symbiote, tried to sacrifice myself, but I was captured. Brought in chains before my people, treated as a traitor. Traded to our sworn enemies like a bargaining chip. Finally -- after years -- I escaped. Fled through the galaxy, hunted aimless... until I'd heard tell of a hero from Earth and his symbiote... and here we are, reunited at last. ,	Characters,Lesser Magellanic Special Tactics Division (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Super-Soldiers,Kree,Kree Super-Soldiers,No Dual Identity Characters,Mike Costa/Creator,Mark Bagley/Creator,Single Characters,Height 6 ft. 0 in.
