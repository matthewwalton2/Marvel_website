Honestly, that's all it was. And... I got sick of being told it was okay. That it was good. That some people were just... just scum that needed shooting. That some people aren't proper human beings. That folk on benefits are scroungers, folk fleeing warzones are a swarm... I dunno. I feel like... Like just needing help is enough to take you off the human list these days. Like that's been outlawed. Punishment for everyone. No wonder they called me a hero. ,	Characters,Champions of Europe (Earth-616)/Members,Red Team (Earth-15513)/Members,Male Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),Secret Identity Characters,Dan Abnett/Creator,Andy Lanning/Creator,Douglas Braithwaite/Creator,Single Characters,Height 5 ft. 10 in.
