	Creators,Stan Lee, Jack Kirby,First,Journey into Mystery #102(January, 1964),Niffleheim, traditionally spelled "Niflheim", is one of the Nine Worlds. It is the far northern region of icy fogs and mists, darkness and cold. It is situated on the lowest level of the universe. The realm of death, Hel is part of this vast, cold region, as is Nastrond, the Shore of Corpses across the Gjoll, where the the serpent Nidhogg eats corpses. Niffleheim lies beneath the third root of Yggdrasil, where the Nidhogg also gnaws on the roots of Yggdrasil close to the spring Hvergelmir.[citation needed],   Map of Niffleheim  ,Geography,Ginnungagap ("yawning abyss") was the vast, primordial void that existed prior to the creation of the manifest universe. In the northern part of Ginnungagap lay the intense cold of Niffleheim, and to the southern part lay the equally intense heat of Muspelheim. The cosmogonic process began when the effulgence of the two met in the middle of Ginnungagap. This created the Nine Realms.[6],In Niffleheim there was located the eldest of the three wells, called Hvergelmir, protected by the dragon Nidhogg. Hvergelmir was the origin of all beings and the place where every being will return.[citation needed],Elivagar ("unknown waves" or "poisonous stream") were the twelve streams, flowing out the Hvergelmir. The Elivagar filled the emptiness of Ginnungagap and froze in the regions of Niffleheim.[citation needed],Like the primal cow, Audumbla, the giant Ymir was created when the hot fire of Muspelheim sprayed to the Elivagar's glacier. The cow Audumbla licked the salty ice-blocks, until Buri came forth from the blocks.[citation needed],Regions,Hel (or Helheim) is located in Niffleheim. The ruler of Hel is Hela and its guardian is the hell-hound Garm ("Howl"), who was located in front of Gnipahellir, the cavern entrance to the Helway leading to Gjallerbru across the Gjoll.[7],Nastrond ("Corpse-Strand"), in the land of the dead, is where stands Eljudnir ("Plague"), the hall of Hel, past the Valgrindr.[7],Midhogg,Pleasure Lands,Shadow Lands,Politics and Leadership,Hela is supreme ruler of the realm ruling from her region known as Hel.[citation needed],	Locations,Earth-616/Locations,Stan Lee/Creator,Jack Kirby/Creator,Dimensions,1964 Location Debuts,Realm of Death,Ten Realms,The Nine Realms (Maelstrom),
