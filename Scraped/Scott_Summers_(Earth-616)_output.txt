Blind to how the world worked…and then I met a man who taught me to see——see how things really were. I loved him for it. And because I loved him——because I believed in him…and, in a way worshipped him——I claimed the things that he had faith in as my own. He called it his dream. It was a good one. But the world, you see——the waking world——where we all live…it is a killer of dreams. A destroyer of things you believe in. So when I grew older, I realized it was foolish to…deify him. Honestly, it’s unfair to expect that kind of perfection from anyone. After all, we’re all flawed and imperfect. There is no real difference between any of us. No matter how much we believe the lie that there is. You see, he wasn’t a savior. He was just a man——a mutant——like me. And his dreams——which still make me smile to this day——are no more valid than anyone else’s. Including mine. I love the idea of that. The promise of it. So what’s my story? I’m a dreamer. I’m an X-Man. ,—Cyclops[src],Scott Summers is a mutant with the ability to fire destructive optic beams.[17] As the first X-Man Cyclops,[23] he has ascended from super-hero field leader to a mutant revolutionary icon.[24] The firstborn son of Major Chris Summers,[25] Scott and his brother Alex witnessed the apparent murder of their parents by the Shi'ar Emperor D'ken.[26] As an introspective orphan and in the clutches of the nefarious Mister Sinister, his mutant abilities first manifested.[27] After escaping Sinister's orphanage, Summers was rescued by Professor Xavier, a fellow mutant who ran a school aimed at helping mutants to control their uncanny abilities.[28][23],As the leader of Xavier's X-Men, a task force with the goal of ensuring peaceful coexistence between humans and mutants, Cyclops guided other mutants in countless missions and adventures[17][29][30][31][32] and even became the headmaster of Xavier's School.[33][34] When mutantkind was on the brink of extinction, Cyclops gradually transformed the X-Men into a more extremist faction to ensure the survival of mutants,[35][36] even going to war against the Avengers during the coming of the Phoenix to Earth, an event that costed the life of his former mentor Xavier.[37] As a revolutionary leader,[24] Cyclops has become an iconic figure for all of mutankind, amalgamating aspects of Xavier's dream and Magneto's ideals.[38],	Characters,X-Men (Earth-616)/Members,Great Captains of Krakoa (Earth-616)/Members,Hounds (Earth-811)/Members,Champions (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (Multiverse)/Members,Phoenix Five (Earth-616)/Members,X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)/Members,Corsairs Squad (Earth-616)/Members,Twelve (Mutants) (Earth-616)/Members,Clan Rebellion (Earth-4935)/Members,X-Factor (Earth-616)/Members,Beginagains (Earth-616)/Members,Future Iron Man's Team (Earth-616)/Members,X-Corporation (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (Time-Displaced) (Earth-616)/Members,Starjammers (Earth-616)/Members,Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Mutants (Homo superior),Public Identity Characters,Stan Lee/Creator,Jack Kirby/Creator,Divorced Characters,Married Characters,Height 6 ft. 3 in.
