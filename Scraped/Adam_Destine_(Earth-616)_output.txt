I killed many men in the belief that my life was of greater value than theirs. Then my belvolved granted me the gift of immortality -- Gift and a curse. In my time I have discovered one is the other. I have lived too long...Watching my children grow old and die...While I remain untouched by time! Feeling nothing. Neither pleasure or pain -- Save the pain of loss...And of guilt! ,—Adam Destine[src],	Characters,Clan Destine (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Mutates,Humans (Homo sapiens),Secret Identity Characters,Alan Davis/Creator,Married Characters,Blue Eyes,Blond Hair,Living Characters,Earth-616/Characters,English,Adventurers,1994 Character Debuts,Adam Destine (Earth-616)/Quotes,Immortals,Invulnerability,Fencing,Precogs,Pain Suppression,Self Sustenance,Invisibility,Destine Family,Marvel UK Characters,Crusades Characters,Knighthoods,Magic-Based Mutates,Normal Strength,
