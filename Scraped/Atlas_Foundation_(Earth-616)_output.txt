	Creators,Jeff Parker, Leonard Kirk,First,Agents of Atlas #1(August, 2006),The Eternal Empire (now the "Atlas Foundation") is one of the most inscrutable, pervasive and enduring secret societies on Earth. It traditionally pursued world domination but currently uses its covert power and influence for humanity's greater good.[1],It has existed since the time of the Mongol Empire. The Eternal Empire was established in the at the twilight of the Yuan dynasty in the 14th century, when it was going to be overthrown by the Red Turban Rebellion and replaced by the Ming dynasty. It went underground per the directions given to them by the dragon who had been advising the Mongol Empire, Mr. Lao.[3],The organization has its own legions of warriors known as the "Golden Horde" and its elite warriors are those of the "Horde Guard".[4] Serving as its commanders or managers are the "Warrior Scholars". Those who are "sensitive" (psychically) meditate near Mr. Lao when he sleeps so that they can pick up images and memories from his past. It's the warrior scholars who are mostly responsible for the establishment of the Atlas Foundation's business fronts.[5][2],In the vast business empire it established numerous business fronts involved in major technological, industrial, media, transportation, and financial industries, including; Atlas Mining, Atlas Auto, Atlas Biotech, Atlas Munitions, Atlas Robotics, Atlas Internet, Atlas Semiconductor, Atlas Records, Atlas Mutual Funds, and Atlas Shipping (maritime). They also created business fronts in other fields such as Atlas Law, Atlas Security, Atlas Mortuary, Atlas Nursery, Atlas Orphanage, Atlas Novelties, Atlas Academy of Martial Arts, Atlas Cookies, Atlas Lingerie, Atlas Marital Aids, Atlas Pets, Atlas Toys, Atlas Pottery Shack, Atlas Hair Salon, Atlas Comic Shop, and Atlas Pens.[6][7],	Organizations,Secret Identity Organizations,Jeff Parker/Creator,Leonard Kirk/Creator,Active Organizations,Earth-616/Organizations,2006 Organization Debuts,Chinese Organizations,Mystical Organizations,Terrorist Organizations,Criminal Organizations,Mongol Empire,Companies,Arms Dealers,Pirates,Slavers,Fictional Countries,
