	Creators,Jason Aaron, David Marquez,First,Avengers (Vol. 8) #9(October, 2018), This holy war has just begun. And we will not misstep as we have in the past. No more armies hitting the beach. No more invasions. Let the air-breathers have their mounds of dirt and blackened skies. We fight for the seas, and those who called them home. The surface world has their Avengers. Now we have the Defenders of the Deep. ,	Teams,Public Identity Teams,Active Teams,Jason Aaron/Creator,David Marquez/Creator,Earth-616/Teams,2018 Team Debuts,Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)/Quotes,
