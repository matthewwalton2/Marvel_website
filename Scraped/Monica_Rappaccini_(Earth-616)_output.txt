One in which A.I.M. created a perfect assassin. An enemy used that perfect assassin and turned himself into the Devil incarnate. This is a world where fear, barbarism, and superstition rule. It is a place where science is dead, and progress has ground to a standstill. It is a world in which A.I.M. has utterly failed. And it is a world that A.I.M. is responsible for. It is our home for the foreseeable future. Pray we are alone. ,	Characters,J.A.N.U.S. (Earth-616)/Members,Advanced Idea Mechanics Board of Directors (Earth-616)/Members,Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)/Members,MODOK's 11 (Earth-616)/Members,H.A.M.M.E.R.
