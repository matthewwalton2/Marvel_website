Howard, Roy Thomas, Barry Smith,First,Conan the Barbarian #1(October, 1970), Know, O prince, that between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities, and the rise of the sons of Aryas, there was an Age undreamed of, when shining kingdoms lay spread across the world like blue mantles beneath the stars. Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen-eyed, sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jeweled thrones of the Earth under his sandaled feet. ,—The Nemedian Chronicles,Conan was born in Cimmeria, a northern kingdom of barbarians, among the Snowhawk tribe. All of his chronicled adventures take place in the Hyborian Age. At the age of fifteen, Conan fought in the Battle of Venarium. After this, Conan, went on several adventures as chronicled in the The Nemedian Chronicles, and eventually came to be the king of Aquilonia, one of the most powerful kingdoms of the Hyborian age.,He battled for, with, and/or against numerous factions (including most of the nations of the Hyborian world, among them Aquilonia, multiple Corinthian city-states, Turan, Zingara, the Aesir, and the Picts), he fought alongside other adventurers, thieves, and pirates such as Bêlit and the Black Corsairs, the Kozaki and the Vilayet Pirates, Juma, Red Sonja, the Zuagirs, the Red Brotherhood, Zula, and Fafnir, among many others.,He battled numerous sorcerers and cults (among them the Stygian wizards Thoth-Amon and Kulan Gath, and the Witch-Men of Hyperborea), monsters, gods, and demons (including some of the Old Ones), and was helped as well by many of those, including the priest of Ibis Karanthes, the sorcerer and half-god Zukala, the albino sorcerer-king Elric of Melniboné, and the god Mitra.,After many years of ruling Aquilonia, Conan abdicated in favor of his son, Conn, and departed across the Western Ocean[47] to investigate mysterious forces which menaced Aquilonia, and discover new lands to explore, such as Antillia,[8] the isle of Na'at,[15] Mayapan,[91] and possibly Zothique.[15] His ultimate fate is not recorded.[47],	Characters,Thief-Brotherhood of Ptahuacan (Earth-616)/Members,Kozaki (Earth-616)/Members,Crimson Company (Earth-616)/Members,Zuagirs (Earth-616)/Members,Black Legions (Aquilonia) (Earth-616)/Members,Picts (Earth-616)/Members,Armies of Keshan (Earth-616)/Members,Brythunian Union Coalition Army (Earth-616)/Members,Bamula (Earth-616)/Members,Khoraja Host (Earth-616)/Members,Turanian Army (Earth-616)/Members,Turanian Army Special Units (Earth-616)/Members,Snowhawk Tribe (Earth-616)/Members,Nemedian Army (Earth-616)/Members,Balkhanan Army (Earth-616)/Members,Corinthia Army (Earth-616)/Members,Black Corsairs (Earth-616)/Members,Red Brotherhood (Earth-616)/Members,Vilayet Pirates (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Humans (Homo sapiens),No Dual Identity Characters,Robert E.
