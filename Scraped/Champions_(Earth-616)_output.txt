	Creators,Mark Waid, Humberto Ramos,First,Champions (Vol. 2) #1(October, 2016), We see it all around us more and more every day -- people with power punching down. Taking lives when they don't have to. Meeting unarmed perps, even unarmed kids, with lethal firepower. That's the world we're inheriting, where violence does all the talking. But we can be better than that. We have to start enforcing justice without unjust force. What happened here today was sickening. And stuff as bad -- worse -- happens every day in this world. The strong abuse the weak -- who have to worry more all the time about who they can trust and who they can't. You want that to change? Us, too. We're in a war for a better tomorrow. Join us. Help us to not take the easy road, and I promise we'll fight every fight they can throw at us. Help us win the hard way -- the right way -- not with hate, not with retribution, but with wisdom and hope. Help us become champions. ,	Teams,Public Identity Teams,Mark Waid/Creator,Humberto Ramos/Creator,Active Teams,Earth-616/Teams,2016 Team Debuts,Kamala Khan (Earth-616)/Quotes,
