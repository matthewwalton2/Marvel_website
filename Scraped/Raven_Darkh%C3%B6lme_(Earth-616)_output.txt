That, my dear, is an excellent question. Though not one easily answered. ,—Mystique[src],Little is known about the origins of the mutant shapeshifting terrorist known as Mystique, the mutant name adopted by Raven Darkhölme being itself an assumed name.[26] As a consulting detective, her services were enlisted by Irene Adler, a mutant clairvoyant who had written confusing passages concerning the future of mutantkind that needed to be deciphered. In their quest, Darkhölme became 'Mystique' while Adler became 'Destiny'.[27] The more they attempted to control the future the more they failed, a struggle that has made an angry Mystique embrace extremist solutions to achieve her objectives. Alongside her wife Destiny, Mystique reformed the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to assassinate anti-mutant politician Senator Robert Kelly, an attack that was prevented by the X-Men.[28][29],As a master deceiver and infiltrator, Mystique made her way inside mutant-related organizations, such as becoming the leader of the Freedom Force[30] and joining X-Factor,[31] the Marauders,[32] and even the X-Men.[33][34] During Mystique's trajectory, the death of Destiny had the most tragic impact in her life.[35] Seen as a treacherous ally, Mystique has proven her relevance for the fate of mutantkind with her actions aimed at shaping its future by forging her foster daughter Rogue into a significant mutant super-heroine,[36] eliminating Mister Sinister,[37] and building a mutant-ruled criminal empire on the island of Madripoor.[38],	Characters,Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (Earth-616)/Members,Hellfire Club (Earth-616)/Members,Weapon X-Force (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (Magneto's) (Earth-616)/Members,Wolverines (Earth-616)/Members,Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)/Members,Hand (Earth-616)/Members,Astonishing Avengers (Earth-616)/Members,Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)/Members,S.H.I.E.L.D.
