I don't know how... or even where to send this, but I was told that if I ever needed to get something off my chest that I should write down. A year ago, I lost my husband and best friend Ben Parker. And yesterday... I watched as my nephew was almost taken from me when some monsters attacked his school. But you saved the day. You saved them all... including my Peter. Now I'm not one for the notion that people wear masks and settle thing with their fists. But I know my Ben would always tell me that With great power comes great responsibility. And if Ben was alive to see this new age of heroes, well he would simply smile his wide, beautiful smile and say... Keep your head on straight and go get 'em!,Sincerely, May Parker. ,	Characters,Food, Emergency Aid, Shelter and Training (Earth-12041)/Members,Female Characters,Living Characters,No Dual Identity Characters,Paul Dini/Creator,Widowed Characters,Blue Eyes,White Hair,Earth-12041/Characters,Americans,2012 Character Debuts,Outdated Fields/Character,Maybelle Parker (Earth-12041)/Quotes,Parker Family,Reilly Family,
