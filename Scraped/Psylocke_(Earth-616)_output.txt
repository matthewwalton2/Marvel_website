In Japan, you can find a statue of her holding a child. Mercy is my name. But it is not my way. ,—Psylocke[src],The woman named Kwannon by the Hand was raised from birth to be a killer.[1] As one of Japan's top assassins, she ultimately abandoned the Hand and became the top operative of the crime boss Lord Nyoirin. This brought her into conflict with her lover and rival, Hand assassin Matsu'o Tsurayaba.[5],After she nearly died in battle with Matsu'o, the Hand had Kwannon's body switched with that of Betsy Braddock, the X-Man Psylocke.[14] Confused and believing herself to be Braddock, Kwannon took the codename Revanche and joined the X-Men.[51] After discovering her true nature, she contracted the lethal Legacy Virus[20]  and was mercy-killed by Matsu'o at her request. Braddock continued to live in Kwannon's body.[52],	Characters,Great Captains of Krakoa (Earth-616)/Members,Hellions (Essex) (Earth-616)/Members,X-Men (Earth-616)/Members,Hand (Earth-616)/Members,Female Characters,Mutants (Homo superior),Secret Identity Characters,Fabian Nicieza/Creator,Andy Kubert/Creator,Single Characters,Height 5 ft. 11 in.
