That is the strength of science. Since I was orphaned as a child, I have devoted myself solely to the study of that sacred power. I learned to channel the white-hot fire of the supernova. The speed of the comet. The quantum might of the supermassive black hole. I baptized myself in the waters of super-science so I might be reborn. Reborn as the cure for cancer. The cancer that is magic. The disease that is you, Doctor Strange. ,	Characters,Empirikul (Earth-616)/Members,Male Characters,Living Characters,No Dual Identity Characters,Jason Aaron/Creator,Kevin Nowlan/Creator,Yellow Eyes,No Hair,Grey Skin,Earth-616/Characters,2015 Character Debuts,Imperator (Earth-616)/Quotes,
