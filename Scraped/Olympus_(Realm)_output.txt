	First,Venus #1(May, 1948),Olympus was one of the God Realms, among the Inner Planes,[2] a small "pocket" dimension adjacent to Earth and accessible via an interdimensional nexus located somewhere on Mount Olympus in Greece,[3] and a small other-dimensional planetary body whose nature and physics are different from those of planetary bodies in the Earthly dimension.[citation needed],Olympus serves as the home to the Olympian gods. Olympus resembles the Asgard (Realm), although it is no bigger than a large city. This relatively flat asteroid-like landmass is suspended in space, and is surrounded by what its inhabitants call “the Abyss.” It is not known if Olympus's source of light and heat is Earth's sun, or a glowing ball of light dissimilar to a star in most of its properties. Unlike Earth, where the force of gravitation radiates from the mass of the planet, Olympus has gravity, which apparently radiates from some point or object beneath the suspended landmass. Consequently, there is a topside to Olympus, upon which beings can stand.[citation needed],There is apparently some force that keeps the bottom and edges of Olympus's landmass from eroding away. This force also prevents Olympus's atmosphere from escaping. Olympus is surrounded by what Olympians call "the Abyss," which may be similar to Asgard's "sea of space." The exact nature of space in the Olympus dimension is unknown.[citation needed],While the gravity of Olympus is roughly analogous to Earth's, common Olympian matter is considerably denser than Earth's on the average. Consequently, a chair made of Olympian wood would be more massive, heavier, and more durable than a chair made of analogous Earthly wood.[citation needed],Olympus is linked to at least four other dimensions. The dimensional bridge between Olympus and Earth leads to somewhere on Mount Olympus in Greece. There is also a nexus between Olympus and Hades, the realm of Pluto, and an apparently artificial nexus between Olympus and Asgard. Also, there is a bridge leading to another realm, from which the Olympian race is said to originate.[citation needed],	Locations,Location Creators Needed,1948 Location Debuts,Dimensions,Planets,Pocket Universes,God Realms,
