Understood feelings before, but simple feelings - like colors, bold and bright. Happy. Sad. Angry. Then... met Spider-Man. Feelings got complicated. Learned guilt. Also the first time I felt fear. Felt agony. Learned feeling: Betrayal. Learned first words they called me. Monster. Parasite. Bad.[...] Feels good to be a hero. Did bad things, too. Can't deny. Mac Gargan was bad. Thoughts like poison stingers. It was a thrill to kill. Knew it was bad. Didn't care. Gargan made it easy. Got to punish Gargan for what he did. He was evil and afraid. Lee Price was not afraid. He was a soldier. Hurt and desperate. I trusted him. Talked to him. But Lee was too strong. Didn't want to talk. Didn't want to be a hero. Wanted power. Couldn't stop the bad things he was doing. Lee was bad. Hurt me. Eddie hurts me too, sometimes, but Eddie is different. Eddie never means to.[...] If Eddie is good, why do we disagree? If disagree... am I a monster? Parasite? Bad? Can't be bad. Wasn't bad with Flash. Fought with heroes. Was a hero. Trained another symbiote. Got to learn. Got to teach. Flash called me partner. Was never afraid like Spider-Man. But Flash is gone... and heroes don't hide. Not from anything... especially their mistakes. ,—Venom Symbiote[src],The symbiote that would be later known as the Venom Symbiote was the 998th of its lineage,[11][12] and was spawned at some point during the reign of the dark elder god Knull.[13][14] Beyond this, much of the symbiote's history prior to its arrival on Battleworld is unclear -- in part due to the symbiote's memories having been erased, modified, or otherwise altered numerous times.[15][16][17],Becoming an outcast of its species for its refusal to obey Knull's will,[13] the symbiote was discovered by Kree explorers, who took and bonded it to a soldier named Tel-Kar in order to use its disguising abilities to infiltrate the Skrull armada, however, when rescuing a ship of Kree refugees, Tel-Kar separated from it and erased its memories should the symbiote be captured. Parting ways when the ship crash-landed,[18] it would later bond to an unnamed alien, who used it to commit genocide against his own species, making the symbiote addicted to rage.[19] The alien arms-dealer Haze Mancer claimed to have captured it at some point, altering it with chemicals to amplify its aggression and bloodlust, but it lacked recollection of these events.[15],Still desiring to protect its hosts instead of dominate them,[20] it was imprisoned by its brethren as they feared it would contaminate the gene pool,[21] this prison being incorporated into the makeup for Battleworld by the Beyonder.[22],Being discovered by Spider-Man during the Secret Wars, it bonded to him and assimilated his powers into its own genome.[23] Unfortunately, it was later discarded by Spider-Man when he learned it was alive and sentient, as he was disgusted by the idea of permanently bonding to it.[24] When Eddie Brock, a journalist who had his career ruined unwittingly due to the actions of Spider-Man, came to Our Lady of Saints Church to commit suicide, the symbiote sensed his anger and bonded to him, forming the villain Venom.[25] Over time the symbiote's bloodlust and hunger worsened until it became too much for Eddie to stomach, leading to them parting ways.[26],After a brief stint with mobster Angelo Fortunato, the Venom symbiote sought out Mac Gargan and bonded to him. With Gargan, the symbiote's bloodlust grew even worse,[27] eventually turning him into a sadistic cannibal.[28] Stripped from Gargan after the downfall of the Dark Avengers,[29] the Venom symbiote was taken by the US Army and eventually bonded to Corporal Flash Thompson, turning him into Agent Venom.[30] Purportedly lobotomized by chemical suppressants,[31] the symbiote sought to seize control of Flash and rampage until Agent Venom joined the Guardians of the Galaxy.[32] Compelled to return to Klyntar by the symbiote hive-mind,[33] the Venom symbiote was temporarily cleansed of its corruption and joined the Agents of the Cosmos until Flash returned to Earth.[34] Forcibly separated from Flash,[35] the symbiote briefly bonded to the cruel former Army Ranger Lee Price - worsening its corruption - before reuniting with Eddie Brock.[36],	Characters,War Avengers (Earth-616)/Members,Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)/Members,Agents of the Cosmos (Earth-616)/Members,Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)/Members,Avengers (Earth-616)/Members,Central Intelligence Agency (Earth-616)/Members,Dark Avengers (Earth-616)/Members,Landau, Luckman & Lake (Earth-616)/Members,Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)/Members,Secret Avengers (Black Ops Unit) (Earth-616)/Members,Sinister Six (Earth-616)/Members,50-State Initiative (Earth-616)/Members,Thunderbolts (Earth-616)/Members,Resistance (Venomverse) (Earth-22249)/Members,Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616)/Members,Agender Characters,Symbiotes,No Dual Identity Characters,Randy Schueller/Creator,Jim Shooter/Creator,Michael Zeck/Creator,Single Characters,Variable Height,Variable Weight,White Eyes,Variable Eyes,No Hair,Black Skin,White Skin,Red Skin,Prehensile Tongue,Tentacles,Fangs,Claws,Living Characters,Earth-616/Characters,Vigilantes,Military Personnel,1984 Character Debuts,Outdated Fields/Character,Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)/Quotes,Twins,Venom Family,Organic Webbing,Demonic Form,Secret Wars (1984 Event) participants,Suits,Battlesuits,Secret Wars (1984 Event) casualties,Shapeshifters,Superhuman Strength,Superhuman Durability,Superhuman Stamina,Regeneration,Healers,Wallcrawling,Stretching,Power Mimicry,Multiple Mouths,Liquid Form,Regenerative Durability,Power Bestowal,Power Amplification,Telepaths,Cannibals,Knull Worshipers,Dragon Form,Winged Characters,Gestalt Characters,Kree Experiment,Fire Weakness,Sonic Weakness,Asgardian Magic,Arthropod Form,Energy Absorption,Pets,Interdimensional Travelers,Energy Manipulation,			Languages			 ,Italiano,Português do Brasil,
